My very best friend and I came on to the city for a concert at The Paramount and stayed 2 nights at Hotel Theodore in the Seattle Made Suite. It’s beautiful! You can see The Space Needle from the bed and the Pike Place sign from the desk window. The hideabed was out and made which was completey unexpected but so greatly appreciated.

Also, it seems nobody knows he city. We had a taxi driver asking us directions to a venue we were visiting (I'm pretty sure it's their job to know all areas of the city). We also asked a cop for a directions and he was just as useless. The hotel staff did not mention anything about the pool being closed for maintenance, not even at check-in. We found out ourselves, unfortunately, which isn't very good considering I booked this hotel solely for the pool. There's no vending machines in the hotel. It has a Starbucks that closed around 5pm and the area doesn't seem to have a nearby convenience. It's quite sad really because the hotel is absolutely lush with big rooms and eloquently set-up to cater to all tastes.",

The person at the desk was friendly, helpful and efficient, making the check-in process easy and pleasant.\nLocation: A few minutes' walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront.\nRoom: Comfortable and clean. It was exactly as described. Comfortable bed and extra pillows. Reasonably quiet. One thing I loved (that many hotels do not have) was the bathroom vanity has plenty of bench space to put your things and the lighting was also adequate enough to apply make-up\nRestaurant and Bar: We ate dinner one night and breakfast here. Our meals were nice and the servers were friendly and interested in having a bit of a chat. The room had a comfortable ambience and it was reasonably busy. There is an English pub underneath the hotel which was also pretty good.\nEvery staff member that we interacted with was friendly and helpful throughout the stay.",

I stayed here during a professional meeting at the Seattle Convention Center, which is a just a few blocks away.  The suite was ample in size, clean, quiet, and provided very comfortable, firm beds.  Full-sized refrigerator, stove, and microwave if you wish to cook. This was a good value for the price (in comparison to nearby hotels), and I would certainly stay here again if I had the opportunity.",

Checking in seemed a little overwhelming at first due to the lengthy emails received, however, it makes perfect sense once you arrive and ensures that you do not need to contact the owners again as the information is already provided. Location is great, being very central to all the tourist hotspots, although, as this is the USA, it still means a 10-15 min walk to each place as a minimum. Very few bars within the vicinity, however, Capitol Hill is only a 10 min walk away which is without doubt the best place to experience the Seattle nightlife (providing you’re not prejudice).  Be warned however that the apartment is at the top of a VERY steep hill but considering all of Seattle is like this, it’s no surprise! \nThe apartment uses a phone app to gain access to the property which means you never have to worry about keys and is very simple and effective to use. It is a little worn around the edges and by no means perfect but considering the prices in Seattle, this is a reasonable price for the space you’re getting. \nMy brother stated the double bed was very comfy, however I’m sorry to say that the sofa bed needs updating as not good at all. Would have liked a couple of duvets or comforters available as the room dropped in temperature in the evening and we were limited in what we were provided. Overall a good experience and providing you’re not expecting the Ritz, it does the job. \nIt’s a shame that Seattle has a big issue in homelessness and drug use, however this was definitely reduced in the area we were based, making it feel less intimidating and unsafe to walk at night compared to other areas.",

It took literally two hours to get checked in, via text messages and links on my cel phone, and even after checking in they failed to send the virtual key they were supposed to send...another hour to find out that the door to the room was unlocked and no virtual key was necessary, despite all their texts and emails to the contrary.

Yes security is important, but common courtesy goes a long way and one could’ve verified my identity once through the door. Biggest issue was parking.

  "description": "The 10-story Arctic Club Hotel, a historical landmark built in 1916, has been beautifully restored to provide exceptional hospitality, featuring 120 well-appointed rooms for the refined traveler in the heart of downtown Seattle. The Arctic Club Hotel provides unique experiences including the eclectic Polar Bar. The interior and exterior design reflects the era of the Klondike Gold Rush. Live like an icon and experience the adventure of history at the Arctic Club Hotel.\nAnchored near Seattle’s historic district on the corner of 3rd Avenue and Cherry Street, the modern Arctic Club Hotel launches explorers into the heart of the city. Walk along the waterfront, venture up the Space Needle, and explore Pike Place Market. Watch the Seahawks or Mariners play down at Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park.\nStep into the Polar Bar and take a step back in time to an era where quality and style are one. Lounge in luxurious leather seating surrounded by velvet draperies and choose from a full bar of local wine, craft beer, signature cocktails, or soft drinks. Breakfast will also be served in the Polar Bar.\nStay close to the action with the Columbia Center across the street, Pike Place Market four blocks away and Pioneer Square, T-Mobile Park, and Lumen Field within a 10-minute walk. With the Link light rail stop right in front of the hotel continuing the adventure downtown and beyond is as simple as hopping on.",

It was after dark and there were a number of people huddled across the street which was a little concerning. We wanted to go out to eat but didnt want to attempt to locate a restaurant so we ate in the bar at the hotel. The prices were pretty high and the service was nothing exceptional.\nAlso, there was an additional Seattle city tax added to the price, so the price you see on the search is actually much higher. I would rather they just add that in to the price you see during the search.",

The toilet in my room was a bit sluggish but water worked and everything was clean. I reported to the hotel that I had a hard time finding information about parking options at the hotel. It turned out they did have valet, but I couldn't find anything mentioning that online so I parked in a garage about 3 blocks away for almost the same price as valet :(.

I know booking.com notifies us about it during the booking process but it can be disappointing when the price you pay is even higher than the taxed price advertised on the booking.com warning screen!

      "positive": "I had no idea how much it was like getting our own little apartment for our week stay, but it really was! We had a washer and dryer, dishwasher, stove/oven, the works. The balcony and view were great, and the kids liked the family room (which included an indoor playroom more for little ones like my 1-year-old and an outdoor playground more for my 4-year-old, 6-year-old, and 8-year-old including climbing rock walls). There was lots of gym space for working out and a pool as well, though we didn't get a chance to use those. We were able to check in early without issue, which was very appreciated.",
      "negative": "We were pleasantly surprised by the large flatscreen TV in the livingroom and in the main bedroom, at first... except they didn't work very well. We rarely got the bedroom TV to function at all, and the one in the livingroom was always freezing up, randomly losing volume, or changing channels. I think it might have to do with all the rooms probably having the same brand/type of TVs and remotes, and possibly other travelers operating their TVs disrupts TVs in other rooms? I'm not sure what the problem is, but my 4-year-old was frequently frustrated by it. Also, the balcony door has to be slammed--HARD--to shut. I'm not sure if it is a matter of the metal door swelling or being slightly too high in its frame, but the top of the frame catches it and makes it difficult to close it.",

It was just a quick drive from where we wanted to visit (Dinos’ Alive), and right across the street is a  Yacht place with beautiful water views! The bed was really comfy to us, and having the suite was great for our toddler to have space to roam. The kitchen was great for saving money on not needing to dine out (except no oven) but I was able to cook on the stovetop & microwave, and store all our cold foods in the full size fridge. The free breakfast is also really great, a lot of choices! The playroom was fun for us. Didn’t swim or workout, but the gym is way nicer than other places we’ve stayed and 24/7. The staff were all super nice and accommodating and even got us a room up higher for a better view! Depending on where your room is from the elevator, you will be walking a lot but the elevators are pretty fast. The lobby is real pretty with a nice fountain and many places to sit. Didn’t visit the little bar/pizza place, but it looked nice too. The balcony is quite small, but we still enjoyed sitting out there and taking in the nighttime city lights. It was also quieter than expected, which was nice. I would definitely stay here again!",

Wine in the evening was a great amenity, getting people to sit in the lobby and the fireplace! The price provided a good value for what was provided.",
      "negative": "Although very friendly and helpful to the best of their ability, staff was not well aware of the neighborhood. Meaning, could not provide meaningful suggestions as to options for morning coffee other than “there’s a lot of options around here!” Or…. Having arrived via plane after 10pm, could not suggest as to where to get a late night drink and snack. A way to get rid of trash from the room when daily housekeeping was not available would be good, other than calling down and requesting. The amoire was funky and ill placed.",

We had a lot of luggage so we couldn’t just take a regular taxi or Uber. It was complete chaos trying to scramble to leave the hotel as a result and we almost missed the ferry. We were able to order another van but it was a panic and boarded the ferry with only 5 mins to spare. The staff couldn’t find any trace of our request despite me watching the manager write it in the book and confirming the night before that the request would be faxed.

A light broke and was throwing sparks within 20 minutes of checking in. The staff was quick to move us into a new room for our safety, but the ice machine didn’t work on that floor which made keeping my boyfriend’s insulin cold a challenge. They thought the fridges had freezers for his ice packs but they don’t, which may be a dealbreaker in the future. We really liked everything else but it’s really important when we’re traveling that my boyfriend is able to keep frozen icepacks for his insulin when we’re out and about.\nAll the issues seemed like kinks still being ironed out since we could tell the hotel was brand new. As Kraken fans from Portland, we’d love to give it another shot and make this our regular game day stay.",

Streetcar station right outside the hotel. Staff were friendly and accommodating,\nespecially Peyton in Ladro Cafe.\nBreakfast food was delicious but limited choices.",
      "negative": "Let’s start with the breakfast. Delivious, but only 5 options - no American breakfast nor continental breakfast, no fresh fruit- that gets old after a few days. I would not include breakfast in my room choice anymore.\nIt’s pretentious. Everything is laid out prettily for perfect IG pics and not for guest comfort. The room was supposed to be 335squft, trust me it was not. when someone works at the desk you have to climb over the bed to get past them.\nToiletries still supplied in small plastic tubes, really? and they get mixed and matched randomly so that you end up with two body lotions but no shampoo or body wash. No biggie but annoying.\nHeating is very loud.\nSmall room despite upgrades. Loved the colorful electric blinds but \nLots of little tech gadgets like a plug in night light and shades don’t make up for a  basically cheaply equipped room.\nZero parking to unload your luggage. If street parking is full you have to circle. \nStaff is not knowledgeable about the area. Michelle gave us completely wrong information and even marked the wrong public transport staton on a map we asked for. We later figured it out ourselves that there is an app to navigate easily. \nShe also gave us room keys that were not working. And forgot to give us breakfast vouchers. All small but annoying things that cost you time in your day.\nrooftop bar: I’m sure it’s super chill in summer but you can’t access it as a hotel guest to just enjoy the view. You  need to first go down to the lobby, check in with a reservation at the desk and then they let you go up. Pretentious at best. The vibe was meh, charcuterie board looked like a teenager arranged it and bar was not fully stocked. Limited cocktail choices. Tried to go up there in the afternoon to take pictures and you can’t. \nNot worth the money unless you want to take endless IG selfies and are looking for a nice backdrop. It does  not feel luxurious at all.",

I could have asked to move rooms but they were so generous with early check in so can’t complain.

The balcony and view were great, and the kids liked the family room (which included an indoor playroom more for little ones like my 1-year-old and an outdoor playground more for my 4-year-old, 6-year-old, and 8-year-old including climbing rock walls). There was lots of gym space for working out and a pool as well, though we didn't get a chance to use those. We were able to check in early without issue, which was very appreciated.",
      "negative": "We were pleasantly surprised by the large flatscreen TV in the livingroom and in the main bedroom, at first... except they didn't work very well. We rarely got the bedroom TV to function at all, and the one in the livingroom was always freezing up, randomly losing volume, or changing channels. I think it might have to do with all the rooms probably having the same brand/type of TVs and remotes, and possibly other travelers operating their TVs disrupts TVs in other rooms? I'm not sure what the problem is, but my 4-year-old was frequently frustrated by it. Also, the balcony door has to be slammed--HARD--to shut. I'm not sure if it is a matter of the metal door swelling or being slightly too high in its frame, but the top of the frame catches it and makes it difficult to close it.",

We received some conflicting information regarding food ordering and any \"take out\" or \"take to room\" options from the hotel restaurants . There was little to no food options in the hotel.",

Meaning, could not provide meaningful suggestions as to options for morning coffee other than “there’s a lot of options around here!” Or…. Having arrived via plane after 10pm, could not suggest as to where to get a late night drink and snack. A way to get rid of trash from the room when daily housekeeping was not available would be good, other than calling down and requesting. The amoire was funky and ill placed.",

      "negative": "My wife had found an adult size roach in the bath room while she was on the toilet. She screamed and I thought she was joking, until I saw her off the toilet and standing in the shower. She was right, and I couldn't believe this was actually happening on our anniversary. We missed out on a 200 dollar reservation at the space needle that we can not get back. I immediately closed the bath room door, cover the bottom of the door with a towel until I found a resolution. My wife did not want to stay in that room anymore let alone the hotel. I called customer service to get support and yes they were helpful but took longer than I expected. They upgraded our room, and got us out of there within an hour and an half. We survived the night, but my wife was beyond paranoid, and It made the rest of the night difficult. However, when we first arrive the room was nice, and it was pretty hot as well. There's no AC. I had asked for accommodations for our anniversary. They provided us with petals on the bed, flowers in a vase and red wine with chocolate. All which were about $45, which is exactly the refund option they offered to give us for the inconvenience. I'm not a fan of bugs let alone roaches, so when I see one I assume there's more. I would not stay here, if you care about having peace of mind.  The toilets were not stabled the best, and the sponge in our upgraded room was already used. Which, typically would bother us. However, giving what had transpired I figured I'll leave a thorough review. This was our first time here, and our first experience. This room mimic a room we had on our honeymoon, and so many things just took that experience away. It was unfortunate, and that's the only reason I'm writing this review. My wife tried to edit the same photo to give you all a better view of how big it truly was.we have a video, but unable to upload it as well. I will leave another room on Yelp, and Google and try to upload the videos as well.",

I could have asked to move rooms but they were so generous with early check in so can’t complain.

The pool/wellness area were fantastic especially during a cold day it was great to go back there and relax. \nThe highlight of my stay was my experience at the spa. I booked a massage with Andrew and it was one of the best massage experiences, if not the best! I left the spa relaxed and relieved from my muscle pain. Thank you so much Andrew, I would come back to Seattle just to get another signature massage!\nPS even the coffee by the lobby is good!! I was impressed coz it’s hard to find good coffee where I live.",

Room was clean and a good size to accommodate my family of 3, with a King size bed and pull out in the sofa (really comfy). Parking was conveniently located on lower level level of garage. The cost was a bit pricey but worth it, although there is street parking located nearby, but you have to walk about a good 5 mins to get to the hotel. There was a gas station and 7-eleven located within walking distance of about 2-5minutes, and also there is a Mediterranean restaurant within a 10minutes walk. Room includes microwave and fridge (which only holds very small items).",

Our stay was 5 days , so you can imagine the pile up of trash and also we needed to change out towel. I had called the receptionist and spoke with a man in the morning (unsure of his name), and with a snarky attitude told me that services are not being offered due to short of staff, and I had asked him what the policy states for cleaning when the stay is longer than 3 days. He replied with \"the only thing we can offer you is more towels.\" I was displeased be cause I've stayed at other Marriott hotels that were the same size and same amount of staff and was offered these services after 3 day stays.  Needless to say I dont think I would return to this Marriott, if I were to visit again, just based off the receptionist.",

The hotel would be wise to remedy this before there is damage that needs repair.  Please add 1 more towel to the bathroom.  We stayed 2 nights and it would have been nice to have more than 3 bath towels.  The cafe was only open until 10:30 a.m.   We would have ordered lunch more than once if it had been open.  The parking is very tight.  Guessing there isn't much that can be done about that thought.  We are planning to stay again in a few weeks.

We had to wear ear plugs all night ! it was terrible . We had to move three times! But the front desk was helpful and accommodating . It would also be nice if they had a on sight hot breakfast in the morning up and running . The rates were very high and you had to settle for a cheap bag breakfast, which is sub par . We had to go eat breakfast out every morning and we did not get a discount for no breakfast. For the price you pay , we could have stayed at another hotel and got a nice hot breakfast in the morning .",

This was on Booking .com conf. # 8514713  pin 1788. I was on the phone with Booking.com for over two hours trying to resolve the problem. They contacted Hampton to try to resolve, but Hampton, as I am told, would not respond to them. The result was I paid over $900.00 for a room in Aug and then another $600.00 in Sept. Booking.com was trying to get Hampton to honor the original booking but again my mistake but you got your money. And speaking of making a mistake. When I registered for the room, I specially asked for 3 nights. I remember this because I held up three fingers as I was saying it. Do you know what it is like to come back to hotel and find out that all your belongings have been taking out and stored because someone punched in 2 rather 3 nights. I guess Hampton is not immune to mistakes. I guess you can figure out that this left me with a lasting impression that when it is convenient you will work with a traveler. Not in this case.",

Let's just say I never would have associated a sense of luxury with any place that indicated that it also had \"shared bathrooms.\"  Well, the Ballard Inn shows how you can be classy while offering shared bathrooms that are kept exceptionally clean.  I felt as though I had the Inn to myself and could only tell others were there by the used towels in the clearly marked collection bin in the bathroom.  The decor is tasteful and well executed and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable.  Overall an unexpected  high quality stay for a budget price.",

It’s also home to a Sunday farmers market that was a blast to walk through. Striking distance to the locks and many other places, especially with a electric bike/scooter. Staff was very friendly and they take cleanliness seriously. This property is residence-hall-style where guests share a bathroom. The staff was on top of cleaning and seemed like they were checking on the bathrooms almost every hour or so. I never once went into a mess.  The area can be a little noisy, but ear plugs are provided. They did not refill water bottles with room cleaning and I found the electric outlets to be troublesome (not enough power and then not able to withstand the pad charger types. Overheats), but I made them aware of the issue and it could have only been that room. Overall great place to stay if you’re looking to get out and about and not stick to your hotel room. They provide the comfortable, decent quality necessities and they do it well, but that’s about what you can expect.",
