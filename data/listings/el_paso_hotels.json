      "positive": "My family (a group of 6) had brunch on Sunday afternoon at the hotel. It was pricey, but delicious. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and all plates were served fresh off the stove. \nAs for our room - all in all it was very comfortable and quiet. The mini bar was stocked with soft drinks, beer, water, and even multiple full size liquor bottles - which all came at the typical higher price you usually encounter at hotels. \nLastly, I appreciated the extra security my room key offered as every night the front doors of the hotel would lock at around 10pm and ultimately the only access to the hotel was offered by your own key card. In other words, you couldn't enter the hotel past 10pm without a key.",
      "negative": "During checkout, I found the lady at the front desk to be quite rude to me. As I approached the desk that morning she looked me straight in the eyes, rolled her own eyes, and then proceeded to ask me in a mildly annoyed way what room I had been staying in. I found her to be unnecessarily cold and ill-mannered - something that I do not usually encounter when I stay at high quality hotels. This is completely unacceptable to me and I hope that in the future hotel management can provide better training to these individuals who deal with customers on a daily basis. \nAnother drawback was the fact that the hotel does not provide a clothing iron or ironing board. The hotel only provides a steamer. Luckily, the staff was able to locate an iron for me, however no ironing board was included. My husband had to iron his clothes on the floor. \nAlso, the shower floor is extremely slippery. I would not feel comfortable allowing anyone who is older to shower alone.",

The breakfast was amazing and so quiet when we went early in the morning. The kitchen staff was very attentive and quick to take care of us (Shout out to Desiree) our waitress.

      "positive": "The executive suite was very large with a good table, couch, chairs, and desk. We could have had seats for 10 people in there and plenty of room for more. I liked the big bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel in the shower (instead of little bottles that run out quickly and fall off the soap shelf).  The bed was comfortable. The Breakfast was adequate with both hot and cold foods, about the middle range compared to other places we have stayed.",
      "negative": "They had staffing problems. One night we ran out of toilet paper, we called down to the desk and no one answered. We went down, and no one was there. Finally we took some toilet paper from the public bathroom. They say you can call for anything you need, but based on our experience that means only during the day. What if it had been something worse? I can understand if they can't find employees, but shouldn't the manager or the owner fill in the gaps?\nThey also only clean each floor once a week which is probably due to staffing problems. I was OK with that, but they expect you to bag up your trash and take it down the hall each day. There was even a sign telling us not to put loose trash in the can, but instead to break down boxes and bag it all up. So no cleaning, bag up and haul your own trash according to their rules, and no supplies unless you are there while staff are on duty. My issue is that it felt like I was paying full price while missing services. We stayed at other suite hotels this vacation, also with staffing issues, who handled it much better.\nThere were several little things that lowered my rating as well. The power plugs at the desk were loose so that my plugs didn't always make a connection. I had to charge stuff at the kitchen counter. The couch needed some pillows to make it more comfortable to sit on. The chair in the bedroom had its seat cushion cover coming off due to a ripped seam. The bedroom had no light tied to its switch by the door. You should have at least one light tied to that switch so people don't have to fumble in the dark looking for a lamp or light switch that works. The same was true in the living room (a switch by the door that did nothing). There were no pots and pans for cooking (So, how useful is a full kitchen if you don't have anything to cook with?) I thought a hotel would have a more reliably functional space, and more in person help and services than an airbnb of a similar price.",

I’ve always said, if you don’t like your job, Quit!\nI’m glad the employees that were there from Saturday morning till Sunday afternoon at checkout made it better. Both the staff at the front desk and the girls at the restaurant & bar were great!\nthanks for picking up the slack! Love this location.",

The front desk was very nice and apologetic about it. There was a lot of noise on our floor as there was some sort of teen age team that was staying there as well. If the room was cleaned better I would give this place a 10 since they don't really have control over their guests.",

Public transportation very close by. Pool and gym well maintained. And above all I like the service from the front desk, cleaning crews, restaurant, housekeeping.

With tip and tax added, we ended up paying over $80 for two mediocre breakfasts. We paid the price for not asking the right questions and left feeling disappointed and unhappy.",

The hotel is next door to the passport agency that I had to do some work with. Starbucks is right in front of the restaurant, like 20 foot steps! It is a no brainer to stay somewhere else.

When we got to the front door, the floor was covered with little pieces of trash, nothing a simple vacuum couldn't fix, also, there was a small trash can filled with trash and someone's jacket that was left out next to the can. When we entered the room, we placed our luggage and belongings on the floor, which looked like it hadn't been mopped in weeks, but nonetheless, I pulled backed the sheets on one of the beds and plain as day there's blood stains on the bed sheets. Old blood turns brown, this was still a reddish pink color. I took photos and went back down to the front desk, where I showed the girl the photos and she took photos herself. She was pleasant enough to offer us a room on the 1st floor and allowed us to inspect the room thoroughly before agreeing to switch, we did. The swimming pool was locked with a pad lock the entire time, allowing no access to use. Also, they have signs posted for an \"Exercise Room\". When I approached the door, it said \"Employees Only\". So I asked the graveyard front desk girl about it and she stated \"that sign is old, we use it as a storage room\".... That would be something to important to update, it's deceiving to clientele.",

I asked the front desk and was advised they do not supply anything for it but I could buy a cheap set at Walmart. I'm not going to do that while on vacation, obviously, so that wasn't a great recommendation for me. We spent 4 nights in the room as we were there for Thanksgiving. Not that I could've made a whole meal in a kitchenette but it would've been nice to have something to utilize the amenities.",

The \"free parking\" offered onsite, is two, yes TWO, free spaces in front of the hotel. And usually when someone parks there, they don't move for a couple of days. So plan to pay for metered street parking or close lots / garages if you have a car. \nOnly other things I would mention as FYI: older hotel that uses evaporative cooling, meaning there's no AC unit in the room. Instead there's a transom over the doors and you open your window to create air flow. I was comfortable, but others may not be. The hostel rooms back into the bars / restaurants and you can hear the music until bars close at 2 AM (almost like being there, it's that loud) - just be aware if this isn't your thing. And finally, there are no elevators, two flights of stairs up to the female dorms (like 50 steps LOL) so pack light.",

Lashes being completely stuck on pieces and complete sides of the sheets 🤢. Bedding was not changed out. Maybe room was not cleaned. Next the TV wasn’t working(turned out to have been disconnected from the back) which I fixed and turned on myself. My point was when I asked 3 of the staff members this was there reply, \nHousekeeping said, “go get it, that is not my job”. \nOther housekeeping said, “well idk go to the front, that’s not part of my job”. \nWent to the room and called and the reply was the same “I can’t leave front desk, you can come for it”. \nThen, we where told to get out the pool at 10pm(which we did about 5mins before). At 11:15 me and my kids go to get some drinks and the pool was full. When I asked the front desk he said “no I told you 11”. \nThen walked off and went to tell them to get out. \nWhen it clearly said 10pm on the door and they had already told us about the time! 🤔 \nI loved the place and would have loved for our experience to have been different. It was supposed to have been our family little get a way 😔 \nI did tell the person at the front desk and he said “you can talk to someone tomorrow”. \nI was born and raised in El Paso, I expected a little better 😔 my kids where devastated .",

TV worked, but the channels are all programmed incorrectly which caused a lot of confusion. All the staff was very helpful and friendly.",

The room was very chilly and really hard to get to a convenient temperature without using the stinky heater (during a 100-degrees summer day!).",

Has a kitchen with plates/utensils/pan/microwave/oven etc. Fyi, no condiments. Tv area with sofa and low table. Dining table with high chairs and a work table with a work chair too. \n- Toilets are well separated. Vanity outside and bathing/toilet bowl inside separated by a door. \n- Breakfast is simple but very sufficient for a full meal. Skillet eggs/bacon taste nice too. \n- As we were travelling with my rabbit, carpet cleanliness was of utmost importance as she's closest to the ground. I was very relieved upon entering the room. \n- I'll choose chase over any higher star hotel. \n- Usual staffs were friendly. We checked in after midnight, and the counter lady was still smiley even at that hour.",
      "negative": "Staffs deployed on 4 July (holiday) wasn't friendly in comparison to the usual staffs. Guy that was managing the breakfast was just drawing on his piece of paper just behind the food counter even when people started coming in. No smiles, no greetings and the waffle paste wasn't well blended, skillet eggs were a tad cold. Not much of an issue actually, but after getting friendly greetings and hot food from the two nice ladies managing the food counter for 2 days, the comparison was too great not to mention.",

Again,  very friendly and said they would have someone look at it and fix the issue. Went to pick up wife at the airport and came back to the room to see the maintenance man working on the system. We left to have dinner and came back expecting to come back to a warm room. When got in the system was off and was set to 67°. I turned on the heater again and nothing but cold air again. My wife told me to turn it off and forgot about it because it was late and it was only for one night. So I did, we went to bed. \nEverything else was great except for the heater issue.",

They have hot breakfast and the facility is clean and always smells good.  There was a younger Hispanic man at the front desk who helped me both times I’ve stayed here and he’s always super nice and professional. Staying here as a young single female I feel comfortable in the hallways.  I’ve stayed other places in El Paso that were kind of sketchy and I like that they have indoor hallways and good lighting in the parking lot.  Their website says the deposit hold fee is $100 but I was only charged $50.  They’re always good about returning my fee.",
      "negative": "My first room a few years ago was pretty nice.  My room this time had some issues like broken tile, holes in the walls, my sink drained so slow that it would fill up while I was using it.  It wasn’t closed or anything.  The shower rod was falling down. This meant that the shower curtain wouldn’t close right and water was all over the floor every time I took a shower.  I did find someone else’s hair in my bed, looked like a beard hair… let’s hope.  Not a huge deal for me but it would probably gross some people out.",
