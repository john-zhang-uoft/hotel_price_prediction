I love that hotels have moved from small bottles to large refillable bottles in the shower providing access to shampoo, conditioner and body wash in environmentally friendly packaging.  But why do product makers have to make the labels…i.e., shampoo…in small non-contrasting lettering.  They seem to find big enough letters for the brand names.  My 60-year-old eyes can no read the labels without reading glasses which I usually don’t wear in the shower.",

We went to the check in counter and there was a large black lab behind the counter who came out and was not on a leash. As someone who does not like to be around unfamiliar animals, this was a very startling experience. My husband had to complete all the check in while I stayed away until someone could come tend to the dog. I recognize this is a pet friendly hotel, but that should not exempt them from city ordinances that say animals must be on a leash or otherwise kept under control by the owner.",

We requested room service and the front desk noted our request, even wrote down our room number. But nobody came to service our room.\nEven the coffee machine was not refilled when we checked in. I would have expected a lot better service since we paid $300 per night for 2 nights. \nVisitors need to be explained beforehand how the parking works. I booked the 411 garage using Spot Hero. But the garage doesn't allow multiple entry/exits. So we ended up purchasing another parking ticket and had to validate it at the hotel, which then allows us multiple entrance/exits.",

Also, the parking was a little confusing so I talked to a staff member and they said it's cheape if you don't have to move your car because each time you move your car its $25. so I repeated it to her to make sure I understood correctly. I asked a different staff member on our way out because that didn't woune right and they said they validate the parking so the whole day you can leave as much as you want all for $25. The first staff member I talked to was incorrect it wasn't cheaper if you don't have to move your car. Either way parking is $25/night. So it would be nice if all the staff new their own rules.",

However, the key card exits of the hotel that were closest to the parking garage were “not working” so we needed to take luggage and small children all the way around the building.  I talked to an employee about the doors, thinking it was our key cards and they informed me that it has been weeks since they have not been working and they don’t know why!!!!   This was extremely frustrating!  Also, parking in the front of property should be 20 minute parking for check-in/out.   The street parking when we arrived was completely full, so there wasn’t a place for us to park to check-in and unload our luggage.  We were not familiar with the area so it was stressful and very time consuming when we needed to be at an event.  We saw the same cars parked in front of the building all day and night.  Finally, we booked on-line 3 double queen suites.   I called the property and asked due to small children and a disabled adult to be close together on the same floor.  I talked with Vanessa and she said that they would do their best.  On September 9th, our check-in day I tried calling 2 times to see about an early check-in and nobody answered!  I went to the property hoping for the best.   I checked in with Vanessa and once again asked for all of the rooms to be on the same floor as close as possible.  She told me that she could do that.  She also told me that it would be at least 45 minutes (approximately 2:00)before any of the rooms would be ready, I told her that would be great!  When that time came she said that only 2 of the rooms were available, the third one would be longer.  I checked in the two rooms and I reminded her that we needed the 3rd room to be on the same floor, she told me no problem.   I checked in with her 2 more times, still not ready.",

From the friendly, helpful woman who checked us in, to Ricky, the magnificent night manager (if he's not a manager,  he should be), every person i interacted with was pretty great.  Give them all a raise,  but especially,  Ricky. \nBecause I broke my face when I was catapulted head first into a concrete wall entering the stairwell to the parking garage by tripping on the stair (more on this later), I was monitoring myself for signs of concussion, so I stayed up and ended up hanging out in the lobby until 3 a.m. During that time I had the pleasure of conversation with Ricky, as well as the opportunity to watch him interact with all kinds of guests,  callers, and situations with skill and courtesy.  And because of him, I plan to come back. \nAlso,  the bed  and pillows were super comfy, and the kitchenette wonderful.",
      "negative": "Even though the parking garage is not owned / operated by the hotel, many hotel customers use the garage to park,  so I'm going to share.  I went to parking garage from the hotel to grab something from the car. Just as I entered the stairwell to garage, I tripped on an unseen/unusually high step and flung myself into the concrete wall in front of me. I noticed later that there is a sign inside the stairwell warning of the step down, but nothing outside warning of the step up. So, be careful. But, one of the things I learned hanging out in the lobby that you would want to know: the parking lot right next to the parking garage is owned by the hotel and only costs $10 vs the approx $25 we paid to park in the garage. You're welcome. Bonus, no steps, hidden or otherwise. \nThere was an issue with our thermostat and the fan blowing out cold air,  which would have sucked if it wasn't, coincidentally, a freakishly warm winter day so we could just turn the fan off altogether and be fine. Also,  I couldn't get (or figure out how to get) hot water when I wanted to take a shower. That was quite possibly an operator error thing, especially considering I had just recently slammed my head into a concrete wall,  but I thought I would mention it as I've been operating showers for 50 years and have never found myself in that situation before. And finally,  the breakfast was underwhelming,  to me. But if you are a fan of microwaved Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches and muffins you will enjoy the breakfast,  to each their own.\nBut I'm still planning to come back,  because I believe that if I had asked, Ricky, would have made me eggs benedict ;-)",

Room on the concierge (?) level - 5th floor looking at a brick wall. The WORST thing....$10/day for wi-fi (which is just stupid and ridiculous) so I used my cell - but the cell service in the hotel was HORRIBLE. Don't know if this was coincidental or by design - but it made working impossible. I know, I know - the pandemic has made staffing tough...blah, blah, blah....enough already - this place sucked.",

However from start to finish, this was never an issue. The process they have in place is so seamless and WiFi strength was strong.\nAfter checking out, Rosa was able to store our luggage so we could do some last minute exploring until it was time to leave for our train to Chicago.",

The furniture in room was a great choice too! I was very overwhelmed by the full scale kitchen and the food /breakfast options were best picks.",

      "positive": "I traveled with my teen to Milwaukee to see a concert at the Riverside theater and we were blown away by the guest house, it’s amenities, and how central it was to everything we wanted to do. We parked our van in the pay lot across the street and didn’t get back in it until we checked out. Milwaukee Public Market, dinner, brunch, all of it was right there and a short walk to all. We enjoyed cruising past all of the folks waiting for ride services after the show and we’re in our very cozy beds within minutes. The rooms are beautiful- we loved the very tall ceilings and decor. The rooms were very quiet, as well, and temperature very well regulated. Bathrooms are beautiful and spacious. The only issue we had was that water leaked out of the shower onto the floor- but we just set a towel on the edge of the shower and it solved it. We loved the 11am check out and that we could still\naccess the building (and restrooms) and our floor until 4pm that day which was helpful when we were still doing some walking around downtown. Such a cool place to stay. Will definitely be back!",

It sounded like we were in an old apartment building and every step above made the floors squeak loudly. You could tell they were not even walking hard. Complained about it, but the lady at front desk just gave me a blank look. I actually recorded it and it was super loud. \nHey I know it may sound a bit crazy, but trust me the noise from that floor above was horrible. Lucky for us those guest were only there for the 1st to nights. Our last night that room was empty.",

I too could have used one to bring food back to my mom in the room.\nYour attendants checking in should also bring the $25.00 charge for extra cleaning in room.

Hot breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage and waffles amongst other grab and go options. Staff was super nice and helpful as my 87 year old grandmother locked herself out of the room when I was not there and the staff let her back in without a hassle even though her name was not on the room. Very nice people.Very accommodating. Our room was handicap accessible and had a shower chair in the closet. Super bonus if traveling with older family members. One of the better options in the area. Location was across the street from a great Mexican Restaurant with an awesome bar area. The hotel bar was also very nice and the staff treated my grandmother like a VIP. I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Milwaukee.",

Needs a few finishing touches, but that’s alright.\nI liked how they’re doing things a bit differently. The décor may not be one I would have chosen, but it does provide some very welcome relief from the usual stuff I know from the big chains.\nThis being a budget hotel, I did enjoy that money was spent on small things that make a difference.\nFor instance, the common question “How much would it have cost them to put a towel rack and a few hooks on the bathroom walls?” did not need asking.\nThe small selection of the usual toiletries may have had Rupee signs on it, but it was name-brand.\nThere was no bathtub, but the shower was spacious with a good water supply and (again) decent storage for your shampoo bottles and the like.\nAll in all, I wish this business a lot of success.

Once checked in, we were not impressed with room #11 which had a foul smell, stain on comforter, black sheet set so was difficult to determine cleanliness of them. There was a random door that guests cannot get into, but someone could get into guest from other side. Room #10 key didn't even open door after green light but after not being impressed by first room we did not pursue it. Handed in keys, no refund, and disappointed in booking.com as well as the motel itself. There was no sense of accountability with the management, just blamed everything on past management since they are in between the transition which I am guessing would explain the name change. Decor was not repulsive, but just not my style so I didn't feel like I was at home or relaxed/comfy at all. Do not go here.",

The room I was moved to (#11) had a musty odor and towels that stunk of mildew (I didn't notice the mildew until I had the towel to my face)...disgusting. I also noticed that there was no hand soap in the bathroom and a previous guest's washing soap bar left in the shower.

It tells you there will be a 25 dollar deposit. Turns out when you get there its really a 75 dollar deposit. Which you get back after they check the room.

The motel was set back from the street, with poor lighting in the parking area and very few cars. The person checking me in can best described as sleezy. Because I had to catch a very early flight, I got up at 4:00am. At 4:45 am when I started my rental SUV to leave for the airport, I found out that the catalytic converter had been stolen from the vehicle. Although I have no way of knowing, my intuition tells me that the motel was somehow involved with the theft because my rental was parked very close to the motel entrance. Now I have to pay a $500 insurance deductible for the replacement of the catalytic converter. It was an expensive stay. DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL. And don't trust Booking.com's ratings.",

Everyone we seen always had a smile and always said have a nice or great day. We didn’t have any problems when we had asked for extra bath towels (usually we have run into we cannot have extra towels no rhyme or reason just told no). But we only experienced the best service from check-in to check-out. \nThe pool and hot tub were very clean. There were plenty of towels for guests. The pool towels are pretty big, so they dry you off really well. We didn’t use the workout room but it was very clean. \nMore importantly the rooms were very clean. The bathroom was also very clean and a nice size. \nThe coffee is available 24 hours and very good Always fresh when we got a cup. \nWe will definitely stay here again on our next trip.",
      "negative": "The only complaint we had was breakfast. We tried a few of the options and nothing tasted good. The sausage had a weird taste to me. Almost like it was microwaved. I had a bowl of cereal but couldn’t have more than a spoonful due to the milk tasting like metal. It was not expired milk - not even close to expiration date. It just had a metal taste to it. Lastly I tried a bagel with peanut butter I had only half of it. I felt bad since I threw away so much food, but it did not taste good to me. There are several options but nothing was to my liking.",

We drive from western canada to see family here so we stay at many places and this hotel is hands down the best one. We always look forward to staying here. The rooms are very spacious, beds are amazingly comfortable and the kitchenette is just a bonus for a family to make easy quick meals. It's quiet, clean and location is awesome for easy access to all stores needed. The staff is incredibly professional, helpful and always welcoming. I would recommend this hotel to any traveller's coming to the area. Wish there were more hotels along the way back that were exactly like this. But none of them compare to what this hotel brings.",

Another big surprise was the kitchenette. I had no idea that was even an option. There is a restaurant and bar on property that were worth visiting. Also, the location was perfect for our visit as it was a 10 minute walk from our friend’s condo on the lake.",
      "negative": "There were honestly only 2 things I didn’t like. First was the loud window A/C. Nothing we could do about it and I don’t think the hotel could do anything about it either. Just a loud unit. The second thing I didn’t like was the bathtub. When I stepped into it, it flexed quite a bit. I am not obese or even overweight. The tub was so squishy, I was afraid the floor beneath the tub was rotting. It made both my husband and me very uncomfortable to shower. Hopefully, it’s just the tub and nothing as dangerous as rotting subfloor.",

We booked a queen room at The Plaza Hotel but they upgraded us to a king suite-- a nice surprise! They also let us check in early to accommodate our early afternoon train arrival. \nIt turned out there was a problem with the heat in the first room, so they switched us to a different king suite, and they also gave us an extra blanket and space heater. It was a short trip but a very comfortable place to stay. \nLocation-wise, it's not right in the middle of things, but if you like walking, you can walk a bit and get to the major nearby sites. Pretty close to the museum/Calatrava \"wings\" addition, which was one thing we definitely wanted to see; and we also walked to the Riverwalk/historic 3rd Ward.\nI appreciated that the onsite restaurant/cafe (open for breakfast/lunch) had gluten-free veggie options, including GF bread! Conveniently, there was also a grocery store,/pharmacy behind the hotel.\nAll in all, a lovely stay!",
