Some places we liked in the past have upgraded and are more expensive than we liked for the neighborhood. And, we weren't in the mood for going the route of Motel 6-double-bed, freeway-side, sketch-neighborhood. The Courtyard, being in a business park, in the slow period over the holidays seemed like a good compromise. It was slightly more money, but we got options for either a King bed and sofabed or double queen beds and a bigger upgrade in comfort and location. Some reviews I read here complain about the need for an upgrade; that the property seems old. Not to us, at this point in time. Room 207 was attractive, clean, comfortable, with plenty of outlets for our devices, easy-to-log-on WiFi. The unit was easy to access because of the automated doors all around the property, and our keys allowed us in after hours. There were both wide stairways and elevator service, which allowed us choice and quick pathways to our room. Great value and comfort for the money.",
      "negative": "The parking fee. The website needs to post the parking fee of $7.50 clearly so customers can properly make a decision about staying at the property. I'm not used to paying for parking, but through the reviews on the third-party site, I was at least able to anticipate and factor this into my decision. The parking lot was ample and it was easy to access the building no matter where we parked, so that offset the parking fee for me. Security did not appear to be a problem, but we tend to not keep things in the car overnight when traveling.",

The hotel is right next to Old Sacramento which is a cute area of perfectly preserved eighteenth century buildings now occupied by cafes and shops.

Gave us a room on 2nd floor. we lugged our stuff down one floor only to find out our keys didn’t work. Had to go back downstairs to get them activated. Employee was very nice and again apologized. maybe could have refunded our parking fee?? The property was immaculate and loved all the channels provided on the TV. We were already bummed that the concert we came to see had been cancelled, so the fact that we had to jump through hoops to stay soured me.

      "positive": "Staff was super nice but its definitely a question-answer forum. It would be great if they volunteered where the room elevators are, that self parking is paid separately (and a different elevator), when and where food/drinks are available and that I should request a coffee maker or else expect room service to be late and make sure I order it early. They send texts with hotel info instead and stupid me didn't realize that's the preferred method of communicating with guests.",
      "negative": "I don't know if Punchbowl is a completely separate entity but no one was at the hotel entrance to the restaurant and there were no signs indicating where to proceed. I walked down the hall on the right until I found someone and was told to go back and to the far left corner to find the bar. The staff was crazy busy. It was Difficult to get service but eventually got drinks and food but I gave up on getting napkins and utensils and used my fingers so my friend could use the one set of chopsticks provided IN the food. We clock watched waiting for Revival to open and got great and friendly service even though we only got drinks. I would love it if at least the bar had been open earlier so we could have avoided the Punchbowl. Definitely Not going there for anything again. Echo & Rig was fabulous and I would stay at Kimpton-Sawyer again just for that dining experience. Bummer to realize at bedtime that I had no in room coffee and then have room service show up 30 minutes late in morning. Lovely view of Kaiser.",

The room was large and comfortable and smelled fresh and clean.  All of the staff were very friendly and accomodating.  The bed and pillows were comfortable. There was a nice ironing board, and a safe. The free breakfast buffet had a great variety.  The outdoor hot tub had great bubbles and jets, and was nice and hot.  The gym had nice treadmills and an elliptical machine, free weights, and more.  There were signs in the hallway making it easy to find the room, gym, ice machine, etc.",
      "negative": "We had to walk to the front desk to get hot tub towels, but it was winter so maybe they can't leave them out due to rain.  Also, the table and couch in the living room area was dirty and could use some refreshing.  The lighting could've been better by the bed.  The front desk was great about giving us change for the washer and dryer, but a change machine next to the machines would have been nice.  Also, the water pressure was weak in the shower and the shampoo dispenser took forever to dispense. The decaf coffee in the room was very bad.  I also thought it was odd that the hotel guide in the room, listing the hours for breakfast, pool hours, checkout time, etc, had a different hotel name on it -- Lexington was their former name, but it had been changed years ago.  Perhaps an update would be good.  Overall, though, we were quite pleased with the stay and the location.",

One of the queen beds was broken from the base so you sunk in the middle.  I didn't complain because it was an upgrade from what I had originally paid for. (1 queen bed 1 sofa bed) so we made the kids sleep on that bed and my husband and I got the good bed. Other than those 2 items, everything was great.",

The bathroom had one hook for towels and there were two of us. \nBreakfast Bar was nice but the oatmeal bar is an allergy hazard for people with nut allergies. The oat milk was in a clear pitcher that didn’t appear to be insulated and was sitting out not on ice or in a refrigerator. I hope I am wrong and the container is insulated. Two days, the sausage was cooked but cold even when trying to grab a piece off the bottom. I took a bite to learn that and then food ends up wasted because I didn’t want to eat cold sausage.",

I wanted to drop the car off at the car rental area and then take a taxi back to the hotel and then to the airport the next day because I'd read that the bus between the car rental center and the airport wasn't reliable. The cost of the taxi was $30 with tip, so that was an extra $60 to the cost of the hotel. When I returned to the hotel after dropping my rental off, I told the same clerk about the cost and she said that she would comp me the taxi cost the next morning. Sure enough, she did and I want to thank her so much. I won't mention her name just in case she might get in trouble for going against the hotel policy, but it was so nice to see someone who took the customer's side over the hotel's side. Thank you again!",

It ended up being $75 which is ridiculous. Usually pet fees are $15. I get that people have extended stays here but the pet rate should be flexible with how many days you’re staying.

I get down there and it’s an argument of the man trying to tell me I didn’t pay until he realized my card “accidentally” got kicked off my reservation booking “somehow”. Very Sketchy. The facility is dirty inside and outside. The Elevator smelled and had a puddle of piss in the corner ALL the time. I felt very unsafe by guest that were staying there as well.",

The room is like an apartment so the bedroom closes off. It also comes with a full kitchen (minus the oven). TVs in both living room and bedroom. Housekeeping comes everyday which is rare to find in the midst of COVID so it was definitely a plus. They have hot and quick to go breakfast options every morning which is complimentary until 9:30 am and even later on the weekend! The area is great. It’s not in the actual city of Sacramento (not far though) but it’s a really nice area with SEVERAL restaurants and stores super close by.",
      "negative": "The TV had limited channels, but you could log into your YouTube, Netflix or pandora account. But you can’t download any additional apps (like sling). The pool and gym are open but you have to reserve them a hour at a time, you can stay longer if the people who are coming after you don’t mind. The only bad thing is you don’t have your own individual access. So if you leave you’ll be locked out and have to get someone to let you back in. There is a $200 deposit during your stay, would have liked to be informed of that when I checked in.",

I just feel if you are going to demand I use this service then charge me for it, then, I should be told by both  booking.com AND at Westin. ( BEFORE making these accommodations so I can choose if I can afford the extra charge) As it occured, feels like false advertising. \nI truly felt I should have the option to choose this service nor given the surprise to the added charges.",

When I pulled into the parking lot, there were several young kids (under the age of 9) roaming the parking lots unsupervised and running in front of cars.  I told the on-site security guard and he said they've been told multiple times.  As I dove to my room, another guest was in the middle of the parking lot drawling cartoon characters with chalk for the other 10 minors outside watching him at 10:45 pm.  I literally had to wait for him to stop drawling before I could proceed to my room. As I was unpacking my car to head to my room, I was approached by a creepy guest in the parking lot asking me if I wanted a drink (he was reaching into the trunk of his car with red plastic cups). Thankfully, I had my dog with me as I did not feel comfortable walking to my room alone. Inside the room, the smoke detector was disabled in one room (laying on the dresser).  There were no knobs to turn on the stove top. Several of the brackets on the closet shelves were loose and coming off the walls. Needless to say, I will not be staying there again. I truly did not feel safe.",

Also, i walked out to grab something from my car and have a cigarette at like 11PM and the person at the front desk *who wasnt the same person that checked me in* yelled at someone walking into the door really harshly. At first I thought he was talking to me and even though he wasnt I felt that the yelling at the front desk was a weird vibe.

We went to the bar downstairs in the lobby for a night cap and the bar tender was so nice and was very accommodating. The chef was the best part of our stay their, his name is Aaron, we wanted desert and the desert on their menu had JUST ran out of it. He felt bad and made my husband and I a special order of cinnamon sugar doughnuts and vanilla ice cream all for free! We talked for a while about life and shared a drink together. He was very nice and very funny! I highly recommend him adding those doughnuts to his menu! 😍 Thank you Aaron!",

I was extremely disappointed that Wyndham did not have the same quality front desk help.  The room was only just adequate, but the location of the room was terrible.  There was no door sign to prevent the maid from banging on the door in the morning.   It was the worst room I was ever given in that hotel.  I had at least 10 stays at this hotel when it was Crown Plaza.  They always upgraded me if they had an available room. This new ownership changed the quality of the stay.  On a scale of 1-5, The Crown Plaza was a 4.5.  This Wyndham property I would rate at just adequate, a 3.",

It is pretty safe. The staff was nice during check-in and check-out. The security deposit was returned promptly on my credit card. It's about 10 minutes from the shopping center by car, such as Walmart. There is a gas station nearby on the other side of the road if you need it.",

The shower was cold for quite some time, as I realized hot and cold labels were mixed up during installation.

Great besides that, I stay at a lot of hotels in a lot of states and that was an odd conversation. I've never had a hotel want to charge more for a Monday than they do for Saturday/Sunday.

So be aware of that or you’ll pay extra for taxi, because shuttle should be provided anytime as other places do…\nSad. Otherwise my stay was fine and customer service was very nice to me especially in early morning, even when receptionist was very busy with breakfasts she kept smile on her face !",

We stayed in a hotel the last time we were in Sacramento and there were homeless people wandering around in the parking lot, some were deranged. At that hotel we had to go out of the lobby to get to our room. At the Natomas Hilton everything was enclosed; there was no outside access to our room. We ate at the restaurant which was located in the lobby. We had breakfast and dinner, and both were very good--especially the dinner special, steak and shrimp--delicious! The room was very nice--we stayed in a room that was designed for wheelchair access, and it was very spacious. The thermostat was simple and it was easy to control the room temperature. The room and the bathroom were very clean. We will definitely be staying here next time we come to Sacramento!",
