Amanda and Dan (asst general manager and general manager) as well as all of the property staff were super friendly and helpful. The employees all seemed genuinely happy to work there. The rooms were the cleanest of any hotel or resort in Tucson. I am very picky, bring my own cleaning supplies, and didn't even need to clean things like the bathtub or door handles like usual. The very first thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness.\nThe room itself was very large (560 sq ft). My room had a kitchenette, dining and living room area in addition to the bedroom and bathroom. Included were all needed supplies, as well as free laundry. It was quiet, good mountain views, and plenty of bath towels, dish towels, dish soap, bed pillows, etc.  Included a full sized small refrigerator with freezer, burners, dishwasher, etc.\nThe hotel itself has 3 floors, a swimming pool and hot tub area, outdoor grill area, a tiny mini golf course, plus plenty of indoor games on the tables like checkers, chess, backgammon, pool as well as shuffle board, and foosball, ping pong and other games in the game room. This would be a great hotel for a group event or party with all the fun game areas where you can sit and relax.\nRooms didn't have indoor mold like so many in Tucson.\nThe hotel was decorated with two Christmas trees and added little touches like pinwheel pillows on the lounge furniture. Very thoughtful and fun décor. They also had a small gift shop with food items. While the hotel doesn't have a breakfast option, they just added a coffee bar with coffee, tea, hot chocolate and apple cider. Marshmallows, cinnamon sticks, caramel, etc. were there for the choosing. Today as I checked out, they had freshly made chocolate chip cookies! I really like how the new GM Dan is added these extra touches.",

There was an issue with the payment I had already made in advance through Booking and which wasn't being sent to them, preventing the system from checking me in. They went above and beyond to resolve the issue. They handled back and forth calls with Booking and their company's higher ups to force the reservation through so I could check in while they figured out how to get from Booking the money I had already paid. They were very patient despite the utterly frustrating situation, and kept me updated. They also kindly gave me a muffin when I missed the next morning's breakfast after my very late check in :)",

      "positive": "Breakfast was the best we experienced in the hotels we stayed in.  They even have a 'Popcake' machine for pancake lovers.  Otherwise, breakfast burritos were available to be assembled with good ingredients.  No hot chocolate though, only coffee and tea.  \nRoom was quiet at night.  Outdoor hot tub was ok, but could of been a little hotter.  The price was very good, but you aren't getting a super well maintained property for your money.",
      "negative": "Breakfast was good but dinner was a different story...I got a veg burger that wasn't actually on the menu but was available and served very undercooked.  I would describe it as pink and cold to the touch.  They did bring a fully cooked one out after I showed the waitstaff.\n1st room was overlooking restaurant roof fans so I asked for a better location and they upgraded us to a room away from the fan view and it was up 1 floor.  These are large rooms because of a separate sitting room with it's own tv.  However, a few negative points.  First, cleanliness score is low here.  See photo of a vent in the bathroom that is easily in reach of a normal sized person to clean.  Maybe some disagreement about who cleans the vents? Housekeeping or maintenance?  Also, the shower/tub really needs to be upgraded as there appears to be some mold covered by fresh caulking.  No stoppers in either bathtub or sink, but I wouldn't soak in that tub anyway, as it appears very well used and grubby.  No obvious bath fan running but there appears to be some ventilation in the bathroom.  Both of the bed mattresses in the room were apparently very well used and maybe had never been rotated.  They were very soft on one side, indicating they were over used.  The room thermostat was missing a cover (photo), again its a maintenance issue. Room windows need to be cleaned as the sun was so bright outside during our stay but because of that sun, the grime on the windows was very evident! The extra room, besides the bedroom, was pretty dimly lit. Carpets were not very clean looking, in the room and in the common hallways. This hotel seems like one with great potential but has hit hard times and just needs to be refreshed.  It really would be a great place, with a large atrium area, if updated.",

One wall had kitchen with medium-sized fridge, microwave, and dishwasher, counter with oval pull-out table underneath and desk chair, TV cabinet with three drawers,another counter with cabinet, and wardrobe with curtain closure.  The other side has nice bath with stall shower and tile floor, sleeper sofa and large round foot stool, and King bed.  One floor and three table lamps, so good lighting.\nThe breakfast area is very welcoming, more like a lounge with a very high ceiling, and lots of choices, with an employee present to clean and restock.\nOur Booking reservation said breakfast was not included, but it was.  It also said parking was $20/day, but it was $16.\nEasy walk to dinner restaurants.",

There was also one time we got on to go up to our floor (4) and I swiped my key card and pressed the 4 button and the elevator went to 2,3 then 5 and 6, then back down to 4 to let us out finally.",

Christmas is right around the corner, so it is not an ideal time to have almost $400 of my money unavailable to me because of the hotel’s clerical error.  \nAlso, my room was in a building that was not attached to the main hotel, with a door opening to the outside. As a woman staying alone, this was not ideal.  \nAt check-in, I was told that if I wanted housekeeping to clean my room during my stay, I should call the front desk the night before to let them know. When I called the front desk to request housekeeping the following day, the person who answered sounded completely confused by my request, and asked me to specify what I wanted cleaned.. then, a few minutes later, a cleaning person showed up at my door with towels and a vacuum. I told her that I wanted housekeeping to come by the following day, as I had asked the front desk, and she said ok, but then the next day no one from housekeeping returned to clean my room.",

Just outside our window was a super nice open air patio that you gain access to from inside.

The only reason I didn't give it an exceptional rating is that due to the historic nature of the property, there is no elevator and our bathroom had a step up into it.  Just something to keep in mind.  We were there on a Monday evening so there was only one music event at the Club Congress.  The only noise we had was in the morning, with voices coming through an exhaust vent in the bathroom....maybe there were workers on the roof??  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Pretty good Happy Hour from 4-6p.  Bartender was very nice.",
      "negative": "No free coffee in the morning.  You had to go into the Cafe and purchase it.  There are also no refrigerators in the room.  (But they were very accommodating and provided us with an ice bucket to keep our beverages cool.)  They told us when we checked in that we were not allowed to bring in our own alcohol because they have a full service bar off the lobby.",

I love the mid century modern vibe and all the local art. It’s quirky and totally different from your standard chain hotel. The rooms are a good size and I liked that we had a mini fridge. The location of the hotel is great - it’s less than 10 minutes from downtown and there are quite a few restaurants and bars in close walking distance (plus an awesome bar with outdoor lounge space and fire pits on the top of the hotel itself). In terms of parking, you can valet or park down the block at a public garage. We were told there was an hourly fee but when we were there the gates were always up and we were never charged. I think valet was $28 per night, in contrast. The gym is also pretty nice - it is a decent size and even has a peloton. All in all we loved this place and would absolutely stay again.",
      "negative": "There are a few downsides of the hotel but they are minor. First, there was a giant stain on the carpet in our room just outside the bathroom on the way to the door to the exterior hallway. It was stiff to the touch and a bit gross to walk over with bare feet. Also, the coffee was never replenished in our room. I called down twice to get more brought up over our 6 night stay and that was with just me drinking one cup a day (if my husband drank coffee too we would have been calling down daily). Lastly, there was sometimes quite a long wait for an elevator - I think one of the three was down during our stay. We were frustrated in particular that the stairs are emergency access only so we had to take the elevator up one floor to the roof whenever we went up to the rooftop bar. It felt so silly to take the elevator when we could have easily walked up one flight of stairs!",

My dad grew up in Tucson Arizona and took us all around this area many years ago and showed us all the Pueblos. This place is so cool and eclectic it was exactly what I was looking for. It had easy access with our moving Vehicles we have a moving truck and a trailer which isn't easy to find parking for. This place accommodated that quite well. The air conditioner Works fantastic considering we are in the desert it was a necessity. The mini fridge was working quite well also and it had a where which is what we needed. We wanted to double beds because when we're traveling hits comfortable to have your own bed. This man was kind enough to extend our checkout time which we had a square since we had missed a lot of sleep due to having to fix a broken moving truck. We appreciated his kind gesture.",

It is located in a lovely Spanish style plaza with two adjacent restaurants that share a large courtyard and have live music. I've eaten at both of the restaurants (Reforma, and Union Public House) and they both have good food and pleasant ambience. The hotel had nice finishes in both common areas and rooms, and particularly nice southwestern artwork in the common areas. I travel to Tucson regularly for business and it's the cleanest hotel that I've stayed in so far. Five-stars for cleanliness. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bedroom had a full-length mirror which was convenient. The bathroom had good water-pressure and the big mirror over the sink had lighting all around it which was good for applying make-up and very flattering. I'd stay at this hotel again.",
      "negative": "In my Booking.com reservation, I asked for a quiet room; however, they put us in a room on the north side, facing the restaurants. I could hear the loud live music when I went to bed so if you want a quiet room, let them know you don't want to be facing the restaurants. Also, the free breakfast was the saddest I've encountered so far (although, decent quality). It had only one hot item, the chicken breakfast sandwich special; no eggs, no potatoes, no meats, no waffle station, no toast station, etc. Although our room was a nicely appointed 1-bedroom with kitchen, it was unusually small. This didn't really bother me but it is the smallest 1-bedroom I've stayed in so far. It was still a nice hotel and I would stay there again.",

This should have been swept off prior to our arrival.  \nWe were disappointed early morning coffee wasn't available.  We did have a sm coffee thing in our room but the cream was bad.  We definitely would have preferred coffee available in the lobby area.  \nWe weren't happy with breakfast.  The food was fine but the server lacked attentiveness.  We had to request coffee refills and then it took a second request for it to be poured.  We also couldn't help but notice our breakfast dishes were left on the table for too long.  We went back up to our room and got ready for the day, when we came back down, the dishes were still there.",

Several things (juice machine, pancake machine) at breakfast were out of order, some it appears for awhile. Someone on hotel staff  needs to figure out how to get the people off site who fix these things to respond quicker. Some of the fixtures and features of the room (place for shampoos in the shower caddies) were part of an old design and might be able to be retrofit more creatively. Someone uses too much air freshener in the rooms, and I found the  \"clean\" smell a bit too much. Holiday Inn Express's brand is clean, comfortable, not fancy but everything works great. My husband prefers them because they offer free breakfast which is not automatic in America. This one has a great staff; they need to support and help them more -- but it's already a comfortable and well managed place to stay.",

I called back and they said they were going to wait until we left before they came up to work on it and clean it. There was so much water on the floor, I took the towels from the bathroom and had to lay them all over the floor. The water left brown stuff in the sink.

People prop the pool gate open and people from the ghetto motel come over and whomever. It is a safety concern and we did not use the pool for this reason. We told the staff and they are very aware of it always happening.. They seem a bit tired of it themselves and I am surprised management doesn't do something about it. It is a huge liability waiting to happen. Breakfast was not good compared to other Hyatts we have stayed at. Bagels, frozen Jimmy Dean sandwiches, a horrible frozen sausage sandwich that has some weir herbs in it that taste horrible...or cereal. We ended up eating at Donut Bar instead which we love. When we first arrived our wall unit AC was not working. Instead of switching us to a new room they sent maintenance in to fix it for 30 to 40 mins. He had to replace the whole unit while we were in the room. I felt horrible for the guy having to mess with the super old wall units infront of guests. The are pet friendly but do not really have places to take your pet potty... and make sure you don't go to the parking lot alone as there are a lot of people on drugs all around and we even saw a guy on a bike with a mask,/back pack meet up with another shady fellow for what looked like a drug deal. The room was clean but towels had stains on them and almost every single one had a long black hair folded up in them. I even went and asked for new towels. The gave me 3 and even the new towels, (2 out of 3) had a long black hair. The next morning there was a cleaning lady cleaning rooms with her long black hair not pulled back into a pony tail...which explains a lot. I am super disappointed in Hyatt as we normally have amazing stays with them but this location is super bad.",

When I called the front desk to ask, she just stated that \"we're a \"hospitality hotel\", so we don't have them in any of the rooms.\". No clue what that even means. If anything, a \"hospitality hotel\" should have more amenities, not less! There were 2 closets, one without a hanger bar, so only a tall shelf above on which to lay your clothes. Then, the toilet didn't flush properly. You had to hold the handle down the whole time, then do that again 2-4 more times to get the paper to go down!",

Some evenings, neighbors would sit outside at the tables provided in front of each unit and it could be a bit noisy.  Fortunately, they usually went inside when we were ready to go to sleep.",

He went to check on room readiness and invited us to relax in comfy chairs in the lobby and use the wifi, watch TV etc. I'm sorry I didn't get his name because it was just a few minutes until shift change and Barbara took over. Most of our wait was with her and she was delightful. She took over checking room cleaning progress and we enjoyed chatting with her while she worked. They did get us into a first floor room, as we'd requested, and a few minutes early. Later we consulted with her about nearby restaurants and she was generous and gave it some thought, made a few recommendations, and answered other questions about traffic and events downtown etc. We felt welcome and cared for, which we appreciated very much.",

It was even staffed with security who could validate our badges. We had to walk the near quarter mile around the block in the Arizona heat to get to the front door. There should be some sort of agreement between the hotel and the convention to allow for ease of access. It's literally staffed for it.

The staff didn’t have a screw driver to replace the batteries so they had to break the back off an tape it back up… the remote still didn’t work when laying in bed, you had to stand directly in front of it to have it work. I would also like to add:  I did an early check in and even had my husband’s name on there as an additional guest. When he got there the staff was rude and unhelpful. They wouldn’t let him check in because they said his name wasn’t on the reservation… even tho I had the proof on my confirmation. I had to call and go through so many automated prompts just to talk to a real person on the phone, just so I could tell them that he has permission to check in. This was very frustrating for the both of us as we were trying to get ready for our wedding that day that was right down the street. Definitely added to our stress that we didn’t need.

The bathroom floor had some leftover trash or makeup or something on the floor. I put a towel over it so it wouldn't get over our stuff. The shower curtain had some rips and tears in it.

I'm sure the gate being closed is more for security which I am perfectly fine with. \nThe room was clean and smelled clean with no fragrances sprayed which I enjoyed. The light smell of bleach, confirming to me that the room was hand cleaned and no deodorizer was used to cover up smells, was reassuring. I was absolutely thrilled to be in a non smoking room that didn't smell like cigarettes.",
      "negative": "The door did stick when I returned my room. I suppose the door handle locking and unlocking mechanism is worn. Had to make sure the handle was in just the right position when swiping my key card to get it to unlock my door. This is less of a \"didn't like\" and more a comment that the door unlocking mechanism is a little fiddly yet not an issue for me at all.",

So it seemed smart to book an $83 room.This was the closest to the freeway. The reviews were ok, so I booked while my partner drove. We're exhausted at the time.\nWe get there around 1:40 a.m., and the area does not look safe. within 2 mins of entering the building to check in, the police arrived and were  looking for a person for some time assault??\n The area is not the best... people on drugs walking around at 2am.thin walls. Just no. Avoid. \nThe restroom tub was gross with some type of dark color  residue.\nThe bed was comfy but would make noise when  you moved or got out of bed. \nThin walls....light sleeper beware. We fell asleep closer  to 2:30am and woke up a bit after 6am. because people were drinking in the front  near our room and being loud. 😆. \nThe parking is right in front of the rooms and you can hear when ppl park and open doors.\nMy partner and I laughed about the whole situation, but next time, we'll know to spend the extra $ for 4-6 hr stay at a hotel, lol\nJust avoid overall.",

They were eventually told to be quiet from staff around 11 o'clock and were quiet after that. \nNormally, this wouldn't bother me but I was taking a BIG licensing exam the next morning & needed all the sleep I could get. It was the reason I was staying here. \nAlso, I felt a bit unsafe as a single female staying here because of the large gap between the door frame & flooring... there was not a seal & created a large gap in the threshold. It would have been very easy for someone to shimmy something between the door frame & open the door. I placed a chair in front of the door to alert me if someone were to gain access to the room.",

They told me all good for when I arrive. Unfortunately when I arrived the night desk person said sorry we over booked we have know rooms I dont know what to tell you. I told him I'm staying here for 8 days paying over 1200 bucks my room better be ready.  Night clerk threw day staff under the bus by saying there are know notes in the system about me calling at all. I told him to call and wake up the manager of the hotel. Then oh my he had a smaller room he could put me in until 900 am when manager got in on dce 22. Manger did apologize they  comped me the first night and move me to my correct king 2 bedroom suite. I feel that after driving 14 hrs to get there, checking and rechecking on my reservations multiple times this should not have happened. Next time may I will stay at embassy suites.",

No microwave in room but one is in the lobby. The location is very far from Tucson central and Tucson west where I had business and in a sketchy part of town. Mushy pillows. Poorly stocked snacks in lobby market. Tv in room doesn't face bed and isn't centered to sofa so it was impossible to watch comfortably, even when pulled out on the adjustable arm. With tax, I paid over $100 a night, which I think is too expensive for this area but you're paying for being close to the airport, and unfortunately where I was doing my business I had no other closer alternative unless I stayed at the casino.",

Walking to the room, the place seemed rundown, but acceptable. None of the curtains hung straight. In the room there were only stained bath towels, no hand towels nor wash cloths. When going to bed we discovered there was only one sheet! And my friend's sheet was stained with two holes. I slept with the sheet folded in half. My friend slept with his clothes on, trying to avoid other peoples cooties. The next morning he found a guy \"cleaning\" a room and asked if we could get two top sheets added to our two beds.  He seemed surprised that a bed needed two sheets.  We went to his cart and found two sheets but said he couldn't access the room while guests were staying there. My friend said we would take the sheets and make the beds ourselves.\nMy friend checked out several things in the room since he knows electrical wiring, tested outlets, lamps and found code violations of the wiring. One lamp was missing its switch.\nWhen we returned after the second day, the water was off. My friend complained and was told it would be back on in an hour. After dinner two hours later, still no water.  He went back to the lobby to complain.  They said it would be any time now - more like any day now.  The water did eventually come back on 3 hours later and I could hear water running thru the pipes. Later, I went to wash my hands and the water was off again. A little later, it was back on. During all this waiting time, there was quite a lot of noise in the courtyard from other \"guests.\"  My friend went to investigate. There was a crazy woman crying and howling something unintelligible.  Other guests were out of their rooms mocking her and being very disruptive.  I guess this is what is expected on a Friday night.  \nAVOID THIS PROPERTY LIKE THE PLAGUE!",

Unknown stain and splatters all over walls and ceiling. Uncomfortable, crunchy, never been cleaned pull out couch. Cheap, dirty, and ripped curtains. Poor layout of the room. No numbers on the doors to discern rooms. Pool unkept, no safety devices or functional pool lounge furniture.  I was not able to relax at any point. The uncleanliness of this establishment is what nightmares are made of. Absolutely worst hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The female staff associate seemed annoyed by guests asking to check in, difficult to understand, and did not understand the function of her job role in the hospitality industry.",

The exterior rooms had an outside area but it was just walled off and not very attractive to use. Terrace cafe was a nice usable area for the buffet events at our convention but it could really use some attention, its just an enclosed Arizona room with no central air or anything of its own.",

I spent a significant amount of time on hold with no response when trying to call the booking.com #.  The chat/email support yielded out of office email replies. Hopefully, I’ll get my money back. Apparently, others have had similar experiences as well. Do NOT use Booking.com!!",

The rooms were very well appointed and very comfortable and there were also lots of areas, both indoors and outdoors to relax and socialize.  Breakfast was cooked fresh and thoroughly enjoyed by all.  What made an excellent experience into a perfect experience was a lady named Dora.  Not only was she here, there and everywhere ensuring that everybody had what they needed, she somehow also managed to chat and advise about people's plans for the day.  Being a program manager I fully appreciate how much work goes into making something look easy!\nIf you are a person  / couple who don't like fresh home cooking or interaction during your stay then this isn't the place for you.  There are plenty of places who offer processed, pre cooked meals and no personal service.\nIf you are looking to visit the Tucson area and want to spend time over breakfast, eating lovely food and enjoying a social experience then I honestly don`t think you will find any better than here. Long, lazy evenings were spent in the outside seating area and were wonderful.  For once in our lives we managed to slow down time! If returning to Tucson I wouldn`t think of staying elsewhere.\nAmie & Dora, keep up the great work, you deserve to succeed 100%",
