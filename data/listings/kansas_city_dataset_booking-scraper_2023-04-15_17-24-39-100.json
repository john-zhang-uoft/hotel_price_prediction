There are many restaurants located close to the hotel (5 - 10 minute drive w/ free street parking in the neighborhoods behind the main streets), which make finding a place to grab dinner very easy. The room itself was comfortable and offered some nice views of the sky-line. Overall everything was clean, and orderly, and the staff was above friendly and although managing a very busy hotel took time to speak to guests about anything they needed from room issues, to good places to eat near by. Pets are allowed for an extra cost.",
      "negative": "Things that could have been better: the windows while a thick piece of glass, did allow quite a bit of street noise into the room. In addition the door on the bathroom would not latch fully, as such that could be an issue for some. While the hotel is a smoke free facility, there was a smoking section right outside of the main door, that was not a pleasant place to walk through to and from the building. Finally, the water pressure in the shower was very low.",

The showers need to have a different design. There's no tub or anything to enclose the water from staying in the shower area. The whole bathroom floor is flat with no elevation, so the shower water splashes and spreads around nearly all of the bathroom floor. In short, it felt like we stayed at a really cheap hotel for what we paid for, but it was still decent hotel just to sleep at.",

We speak with the manager he’s a business man and tells you what you want to hear told me a bunch of bs and that he would call me by noon with a resolution. We leave go have breakfast ANOTHER charge this time for the price of the room. so now over 300+ dollars just completely lost. we go back talk with him and have booking.com rep on the phone as well and the rep in fact told him that they charged my husbands acct AGAIN!  the manager will make you feel like the idiot but he is literally the crooked of the crooks!

      "negative": "There is no way to register your vehicle through guest parking online, even if the room is purchased online. Furthermore, there is nowhere to park prior to checking in. Guests have to circle the block multiple times to compete with extremely limited street parking. When attempting to park & find my way into the building, one outside staff member was very unhelpful. The man was sweeping & just kept repeating where I couldn't park, but couldn't seem to give basic information when asked where I could park or where the building entrance was. \nOnce inside the lobby, the scent/odor (meant to be pleasant) was overwhelmingly noxious! I do NOT have asthma, but experienced bronchial spasms & felt like my airway was chemically irritated by the overpowering concentration of fragrance in the air. I was concerned the room would be the same & did develop a mild headache. Thankfully, the room air smelt fine. There are no room refrigerators or food vending machines on each floor, only one small food display @ lobby check/in desk/shop. Room clock & one lamp didn't work. For the price of the room, guests should not have to pay $10/night for WiFi. This is typically a free amenity at most nice hotels/resorts. In addition, the bandwidth & strength of the network service offered was very weak. Some of the room/facility policies I read online, ie. the cancelation policy, seem unethical & very business/profit centered. Overall the experience of my stay felt  impersonal. The only welcoming part was while communicating with the lady who proceeded my check- out!",

The parking space was unexpectedly huge for a downtown hotel - almost as big as a suburban strip mall parking lot but secure.

The breakfast staff made sure you were supplied with different options for hot breakfast (a good one). Their beds and pillows are always the best.",
      "negative": "I had higher expectations having been in a Home2 Suite before in Dallas. This one showed signs of aging and lack of a detailed eye for maintenance. Our lamp was acting up (a plug point popped out creating a risk for electrocution). In the process of trying to rectify it (a piece of tape was what I suggested because I did not want to be difficult), the entire bank on one side of the room went dark with our phones etc left uncharged because of some electrical shorting. The friendly maintenance guy did try to take care of us within his means. The shower soap dispenser popped out while trying to use it. The shower door has become scuffed and discolored with lack of repainting. This was an expensive Home2 Suite (maybe the inflation price shock to some degree IDK) but my high level of expectations were set by my earlier stay in a Home2 Suite at a much moderate price.",

Also only part of the elevators worked at one time making it hard to get back and forth from the room to the conference.

We were just in Europe for several weeks (some Marriott properties too) and every day we had full service and that's what we pay for.  For $250 +taxes equaling $300 per night, I feel as thought the least service you can provide is making up the bed and fresh towels.  Service industry is definitely not servicing up to expectations.

The staff from valet, to check in, housekeeping, check out were extremely helpful and very friendly considering there were hundreds of guests on site for various activities and not all were pleasant.  The views of the city were absolutely beautiful at night! Very relaxing. All in all, I would highly recommend the Sheraton as “THE” place to stay for business or pleasure as they live up to the hype in my opinion!",
      "negative": "The pillows on the beds are not comfortable. They’re too thin and soft once you lie down on them. Upon first glance, they look so comfortable. But, once you lie down, it’s not as comfortable as it should be. The toilets are really low. I’m almost 6 feet tall, and I felt like I was close to the floor once I got close to the seat. The children needed no help of course because it was at the perfect height. The elevators were a bit slow, but that was probably not the fault of the hotel since there were so many guests and children going up and down.  There were also a lot of inconsiderate guests allowing the room doors to slam shut in the evening which made it a bit difficult to keep a baby asleep.",

It was most disappointing that the mezzanine floor was closed down and the restaurant and bar supplement was not conducive and we couldn’t access the Link or the round room on the top floor . This could have been better planned. The things that brought me back to the hotel was a disappointment this time.

      "negative": "It's incredibly hard to list all the didn't likes. I'll try to list the main issues.\n1) the entire place looked like a remodeling warzone. Probably why the breakfast was not available. They did have lemonade in the lobby though.\n2) see picture, sadly it's the only one we took. But it looked like rooms were in process of being remodeled and stopped to rent out.\n3) bedding, pillows, sheets, etc has incredibly disgusting stains. Had to request replacements for almost all of them.\n4) bathrooms were incredibly small and cramped. \n5) circular air fresheners were all over the place to hid odors, some we figured were from smokers in non smoking rooms and other odors we didn't want to know.\n6) requests for additional towels had to wait till next day when laundry service started up again.\nThose are the main issues, problem is, La Quinta's are not known for being the same thing as Motel 6 but in this instance it was. I am guessing it's because of the remodeling going on. Perhaps they didn't want to shut down parts of the hotel while they remodeled?\nThis hotel has 2 wings to it, so they could have easily shutdown one wing and remodeled while the other was rented out. It seemed that every floor had something going on and wrong with it.\nI think this place needs to finish doing whatever it was doing and then another review can be made and it could have more positive outlook. Right now, sadly, bad review for a hotel chain that has been pretty good.",

It should have been a clear sign when we first pulled in for check in and there was a detective and sheriff also walking at the same time.. we won’t be back. the staff, was semi friendly, if they even spoke with ya!",

I realize hotels are getting back on track post COVID so am trying to be somewhat diplomatic here, but the hotel felt like it nickled and dimed us to death. The gambling experience was sub par, not the fault of the employees, but of the management. Surprised they didn't charge for parking.",

      "positive": "The room was very nice, the staff very good (the front desk at check-in was a bit stiff, and did not give me 3 keys when I requested them) otherwise the bellmen, and cleaning staff were very hospitable.  The young man Jon at the front desk was very helpful.  The bartender was very good.  The fitness center was very nice, nicer than some gyms I have been to, especially the locker room.  Pool area is very nice but too cold to use.  Nice access to the Plaza area and walkable.",
      "negative": "Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 I presume, the bar was not open late.  There was no breakfast service, No real restaurant to speak of, but the hotel across the street was serving.  We were there for a wedding reception.  We had four children who needed children's meals.  They served all adults first, and we were all pretty much done with our food and we had reminded the wait staff we needed children's meals and were told they were coming.  Finally, I had to track down a manager and insist we get some children's meals.  They did finally respond and serve the meals.  Children get antsy and should be fed first so the parents can enjoy their meal.  Finally, I hate that I reserved my room months ago, and before the wedding, I was able to get a rate at least $50 a night cheaper.  Even cheaper than the block rate.  In addition, early on they said the block was full, well expand it! There was plenty of room in the hotel, not full.  Offer the best rate to wedding guest or locked groups.",

There is not enough parking for hotel guest. This made it difficult for visitor parking because it’s shared with paid guest which isnt fair. Housekeeping was my only cleanliness issue. The linen was apparently not changed because there was vicks vapor rub trash under the top sheet. Gross. Regardless of appearance, linen should be changed between every guest. I am a former health inspector for the city and can confirm this to be against the code. The shower is small so it was difficult to thoroughly wash. Especially when The shower head was not able to be lowered. It sprayed really hard pressure water at my neck which was not soothing. Maybe it was broken",

The pool temperature was very cold and uncomfortable to swim in. The pool was closed for a portion of the time and when it opened back up the water was colder than before. The water was also green. The amount of chlorine caused rashes on our children. The breakfast was cold both days and food was not replaced when it was out. Our room smelled like sewer water. We asked to change rooms due to the smell and were told we had to wait until they got back to us. There were stains on the carpet, stains all over the walls, black hair in the shower and on towels. Part of the bed was sticking out.",

The buffet breakfast at $20 per person was good but many of our family members wanted breakfast but not a whole buffet.

Major red flag since the policy states pets are welcome with no restrictions on breed or size (no mention of dogs or cats on booking.com or the Sonesta website). After a verbal challenge, I was allowed to have the cats stay but I was not happy with the underlying issue. Also, no breakfast served.

Plenty of storage space for clothing and accessories; with draws and hangers used for storage. The pool is nice and big; with a lift if needed. Breakfast wise there is a good selection available, with a few hot items, and plenty of cereal, fruit and yogurts. They have tea and coffee options, with apple and orange juice, as additional options. There is a small shop found in the lobby, selling a few snacks, and simple dinners.",

And that was wearing a jacket.  My husband felt the same way as well as the couple we traveled with.   It will not keep us from returning, as we have now made it a yearly tradition to return to Unity. However, it would sure be more enjoyable if the temperature was more comfortable.  To be fair, I did not make a formal complain but I did mention to the front desk that it was just too cold to stay in that area to eat and she agreed.",

      "negative": "The hotel room looked like the scene of a crime. It had been cleaned, but only just barely. There was broken glass on the office chair and a square of carpet cut out of the floor which was replaced by a different colored carpet segment. The bathroom had splatter stains (maybe wood stain from refinishing the door?) and random curly hairs on the walls up to the ceiling. \nMy favorite feature was the two way mirror which extended the length of the room behind the headboards of our queen beds and a strategically placed smaller mirror on the opposite wall. We spent an indeterminate amount of time trying to see what was behind that mirror. \nWe scoured the room to make sure there were no secret entrances for a human trafficking scenario and found discarded sex toy packaging left in the room by the previous guests.  The sheets displayed a smattering of body fluid stains.\nAfter we covered all the mirrors with sheets and blankets and pushed a dresser up to the door (which wouldn't deadbolt without extreme effort) we were able to get a few hours of sleep. \nOverall, maybe it was worth the $80, but I wouldn't stay here again even if they fixed the broken lock on the external ground level door allowing anyone and everyone to enter the hotel.\nIf you want to save a little bit of money and still have decent wifi and TV, this is your place. If you are looking for a safe haven during a layover or a nearby convention, this is not the room for you. \nSorry to the management for the poor review. You guys seemed nice, and I'm not usually one to scathe, but this was bad enough that I need to warn other travelers.",

The room had a fully stocked kitchen (pots, pans, cooking burner, ceramic plates, etc!!!) and extremely comfortable bed, good furniture, and a really nice breakfast that even had vegan options (fruit, oatmeal, plant milk for oats and coffee, etc...).

I wrote in my reservation a request to confirm the availability of the shuttle at my arrival time, but did not receive a reply.  On arrival, I called and was informed that they no longer offer that service due to Covid, so I had to pay $15 for a taxi to bring me here - and had to do so again to get back to the airport.  I was then informed at check-in that they no longer offer breakfast due to Covid - and there are no food/restaurant facilities anywhere in the vicinity.  Both of these services are clearly noted in the listing . . . and since the Covid situation has been around for nearly a year now, there has been more than enough time to change the listing to be more honest!

From the lobby, restaurant/bar leading up to your room is Hilton standard.  My room was nice, spacious & clean. The only complaint about the room is that the ottoman could be changed out for sure. The leather was peeling off bad and you can hear quite well other guests in the hall way. So I don’t know if that’s from just the guest being extra loud or the room walls are just that thin but nevertheless I enjoyed my stay and would recommend this Hilton",

I opened the sliding door (no balcony, but there's a balcony door with a rail on the outside of the window) and the windows in the bedroom (which could only open 2-3 inches because they put a guard on it), and it still smelled the next day. I also got a room with a pull-out bed, and there was no bedding to make up the bed, so someone brought some to the room for us. When I made the bed up, my daughter said she couldn't sleep on it because it was so lumpy. I ended up putting the pull-out back into a couch and she slept on it that way. The wallpaper in the bathroom was looking pretty bad by the showerhead and the corners in the bathroom were gross, there was also some kind of sand or dirt or something on the bathroom floor, so it was definitely NOT clean. Our TV remotes were also in little clear bags, which I thought was odd. The pool was okay, but the hot tub is permanantley closed, and that was a bummer.",

He complained about people smoking at the front side of the building due to vents and smoke going in them. My daughter stayed there with me as I had to have infusions each day which I have to return for every 2 weeks. The elevator and whole 3rd floor smelled like urine and the marijuana was so strong it burnt our eyes. We couldn't open our window cause they didn't have screens. There was no coffee pot or bagged breakfast as stated. I had to leave to buy these items. The parking lot had beer boxes and trash everywhere. Me and my daughter picked it up and took it in the gentleman didn't offer to take it to the trash. I can barely walk due to SPS. We waited at the front desk 4 times for over 10 minutes and no one was around to help us? Had to pay extra for wifi just to be able to FaceTime and give my family updates on my medical treatments.",

The kitchen cabinets were dirty and looked to not be cleaned on the inside. Expected cups or something inside the kitchen cabinets.

No waste basket in the room. Common areas of the hotel were grimy and old looking. Clearly this place isn’t even up to normal standards of cleanliness, much less any pandemic-level sanitation.

We did not expect a full kitchen and it was a definite bonus. The breakfast in the morning is always nice but, it was great to pinch some pennies and cook our own lunches at the hotel. Having separate living and bedroom area was also an unexpected bonus-- while our daughter napped in the bedroom, it allowed for my husband and myself to relax and watch TV in the living area. It was very quiet, the room extremely clean and the area not too far from the city. 10 out of 10!",

From the moment we checked in, we were impressed with the friendly and attentive staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome.\nOur room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with comfortable beds and modern amenities like a flat-screen TV and free Wi-Fi. The bathroom was spotless and stocked with plenty of fresh towels and toiletries.\nWe were also pleased with the hotel's facilities, which included a fitness center, indoor pool, and hot tub. The complimentary breakfast buffet was also a highlight, with a variety of delicious options to choose from.\nOne thing that really stood out to us was the hotel's convenient location. It was just a short drive from downtown Kansas City, which made it easy to explore the city's attractions and restaurants.\nOverall, we highly recommend Fairfield Inn & Suites Kansas City North/Gladstone to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in the Kansas City area.

But when we returned later, the towels were all still on the floor, trash hadn’t been taken, and beds were unmade. It wouldn’t have mattered if they hadn’t come to the door to ask us to clean, but since they did ask and then didn’t clean, we were confused by it. We talked to Erica about it and she explained the housekeeping protocol since Covid is usually by request, we didn’t know that early enough. To make up for it though, she offered complimentary refreshments for our journey, and talked with us at length about it until we were satisfied.",

The towel bar fell off the wall when I took the towel off the rack.  We requested to have our room cleaned and had it put on the list the night before but it was never cleaned. We had to keep going to front desk to get new towels and had to set the old ones in the hallway just to keep them from building up in the room. They sat in the hallway over night and into next day until someone grabbed them.  When we let the front desk know about these issues they were very apologetic and took off one nights stay.  We appreciated their response.",
