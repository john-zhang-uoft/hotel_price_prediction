As a Canadian I am aware of the social &  economic challenges and conflicts in the US, but I found virtually all your staff to be excellent, with the exception of the day clerk on Friday 10/21 ( who seemed bored and disinterested in my business upon arrival ) and again on Monday 10/24th ( who could barely manage to get off her chair behind the encounter to provide a print out of my bill ) After decades of managing staff from clerks to top managers & sales people, these two individuals need significant training and attitude adjustments, or should be given the opportunity to pursue a new line of employment.\nLastly , of my 3night / 4 day stay my room was “ treated “ to housekeeping ONCE , after I twice requested it .\nNo apologies , no consideration at checkout or otherwise ( in Canada it is customary to offer either a credit on one’s bill or a voucher for future stay ).

When he pushed down, the sanitizer squirted out in multiple directions getting on his close and left eye.  He told the lady working the front desk who told him there’s nothing she could do for him short of calling 911.  His eye got very red and teared for a couple of hours.  She never apologized or anything!!!!  She pushed down on the pump and said “it works OK for me”.  Very poor customer service!  She should have gotten him a cold wet wash cloth at a minimum!!

Hotel has 2 bars-Ash and Blooms.  Both are a delight on the senses.  Restaurant is in Ash Bar and was 5 star quality.  Room was simply adorable with 4 poster bed, custom thermostat, ample outlets (no USB) and a bathroom with WOW factor!  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Pro tip: parking on street is free beginning 6 pm Saturday and all day Sunday.  Otherwise the meter is $1.75/hour from 8am-6.  There is a garage nearby-not sure of cost.  For anyone over 50, bring your flashlight lol lighting everywhere is dim.  Sets an intimate ambiance but can be challenging finding things like elevator electronic access pad or reading menus.\nNothing 'corporate ' here and amuch needed and welcome change to the typical hotel.  Like Baltimore 's moniker \"Charm City\", this hotel oozes turn of the century luxury with a hint of the quirky.  Make sure you read the newspaper in your room.  Best horoscopes ever. I suspect John Waters helped write them lol",

      "negative": "When we arrived (on our anniversary day) the hotel front desk person could not find my reservation. Asked if it was under a different name (it wasnt). It took 20+ minutes of standing and waiting before they finally figured it out. The female did not seem very concerned or interested about the mixup, didnt really offer any apology. Strange attitude, like she couldnt be bothered. THere is a park next to the hotel at the end of hte pier that homeless people sleep in, somewhat unsettling, but the Inner Harbor area itself has a problem with homelessness and drugs so cant blame the hotel. The lock on the balcony door did not lock.  On a couple occasions we had to wait extraordinarily long for an elevator, despite that theres only 2 floors and 2 elevator shafts, and the hotel was not even close to full capacity - we believe the hotel staff was holding the elevator on the lower floors for service since they are double-sided elevators. No other explanation to be waiting 5 minutes for an elevator in that scenario. Some guests may complain about the parking, there is a public lot right next to the hotel and the hotel comps your parking, really not that big of a deal at all just to clarify.",

It was a very nice room. The bed was very comfortable. The service was excellent and friendly. The rooftop restaurant is also excellent. \nWhen we left I accidentally left a pair of Maui Jim  sun glasses behind. When we got home to Atlanta ,my wife called the hotel and asked if they had been found. I fully expected that they would say no. But the person who answered the phone said she would check, and she then said they had been found. Moreover, she offered to mail them to me. Two days later a Fedex package arrived with the glasses. I was thankful and impressed. Clearly this was service above and beyond. The Revival is definitely a great place to stay in Baltimore.",

As we paid for breakfast when making our reservation, we were refunded the money we had paid, which was fair. That said, we did have dinner at the restaurant the night we arrived. I'd have to rate the dinner a 7. Fair only. Pricy especially because it wasn't a good meal. That said, love the hotel and would stay again. Liked the vibe of the place. The art. The fitness room.

The Indigo seemed to be in a good location to do that, and it was cheaper than the alternatives when I booked. I walked the few blocks north to the hotel on arrival (through Baltimore's rather scuzzy downtown business district) and then took the light rail to the airport from Centre Street when leaving. Convenient. The Roman Catholic Cathedral is across the street, and all of Mount Vernon (and numerous bars and restaurants) is right there. Lexington Market is just a few minutes away. I felt safe, although a 7-Eleven nearby was robbed on the morning I left. . . . My room was comfortable and had a great view over the rooftops toward the Washington Monument. I didn't try the restaurant, except to have a quick drink at the bar, but it looked good. Staff members were friendly, funny, and helpful. I would've liked to have stayed longer.",

If you have a room reserved for a guest, make sure the room is ready!\nAlso, just my opinion, but I think the bathrooms could use an update.  Step in tub to shower.  Showerhead  not positioned for tall people.  And toilet seemed to be sized for short people!  LOL!\nGuests came up on the 9th floor and was making a lot of noise, totally ignoring the \"quiet area\" sign.  I am all about having a good time, but people should be respectful to other guests!",

Look at the main problem...\nFirst of all, let me say that most of the employees are helpful and friendly. I did not have any problems with the reception staff, the floor staff or the staff in the restaurant; I even became friends with some of them because I stayed for 1 week. On the last day (20.11.2022), when I was checking out in the morning, I REQUESTED a young lady at the reception to call me a taxi. This lady sullenly said she couldn't call a taxi, that's not her job (???). Then she handed me a card and said you can call it from here if you want, and went to the inner room with the open door and tried to sleep on the chair (???). Since there was a problem with my phone and I did not know the address information correctly, I asked him to help me again. She looked at me with an angry and hopeless look and said she couldn't do that. After all, the taxi I called took the order in a sleepy voice and said she would come in 10-15 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes, I called him again and he picked up the phone and hung up without answering. When I called again, he had now completely turned off his phone. On the same day, there was a game in the city and the traffic was heavy. It was very difficult to find a taxi. I went in front of the Hilton with my 2 big suitcases, I was able to find a taxi from there. But when I went to the train station, my train to Philadelphia had already left ))) The behavior of this lady, who was on duty on the last day, for no reason, destroyed my ideas about the establishment. Second time I will never stay at this hotel. After all, we do not know in advance what kind of person will be on duty when we need help.",

We happened to be there Easter night when all the trouble happened . Personally, I don’t think I will be back , unless things change .

The bathroom we could barely turn around in and they placed only one set of towels in the room. Usually you get 2 and again booking a double room you would think that would be considered.

We had to park in a parking garage that was a block away which is not bad if you can unload your stuff in front of the hotel but you can't because people are parked in the spaces that are ment for paying customers.  To have to lug all your luggage along with a infant child and everything you need is really inconvenient and not safe. We stayed from Saturday to Sunday so the parking fee was not bad but it looks like any other time parking cost about 26 overnight which they don't tell you when booking the room. Also for the cost and they type of hotel you would expect they would offer a continental breakfast but they don't. All in all my stay was good and the staff was nice but my next stay I will definitely book a hotel that offers parking and a breakfast.",

Beds only have a top sheet and no blankets. Although it was mostly quiet the walls are super thin and I heard some strange noises from the adjoining room(s).

Wasn't worth trying to rebook for $10.  But now had to scramble to figure out what to do with parking and cost. This was the main reason why we stayed there. 7-Day included with the stay for a cruise. So beware if that's why you're staying there call first. Option is to stay at a different hotel that actually does allow to leave your car.But we were able to leave our cars next door for $5 a day at the Comfort inn.",

I found an eyelash under one of the pillows which freaked me out so I slept on top of the covers and used a shirt over the pillow so my face wasn't touching the linens. Traveling during a pandemic is a little freaky... last thing I want to see is someone's body hair on my bed.  \nThey charged me $30 to park there for about 8 hours! Bringing my total cost to almost $300. There was some kind of loud country line dancing instruction going on in the lobby when we arrived.

However, I simply couldn't believe how the former excellent restaurant area has been reconfigured into a basic \"cafeteria-style\" open-plan area contiguous with the lobby where, had I wished to enjoy an evening meal, I'd be basically sitting in  full view of the bar and arriving guests. No privacy, no style. As I stood waiting to be seated, the waiter thrust a menu in my general direction as he hurried to simultaneously serve people in the bar. When I asked at reception whether there were suitable restaurants nearby, she sighed in sympathy and admitted the place has suffered greatly due to the pandemic. The bedrooms are still luxurious and spacious but why pretend this place is a first class hotel and charge the same when it has clearly gone downhill - disappointed and poor value for money. For this price it desperately needs a proper restaurant, not something like one witnesses at cheap airport hotels.",

I have easy access to the CityLink/LocalLink bus lines and the Charm City Circulator. It's too far east to be close to the Light Rail. I also liked using the porch to relax and sit outside on the ledge at night after work or during the early mornings before I leave. The King sized bed was SO comfy and easy to maneuver in that I'm thinking about getting one for myself when I moved into my next apartment. I loved that there was storage (empty 3-drawer dresser and a full-sized closet), laundry facilities and plenty of seating areas on the first floor and the basement. \nIt's the perfect place to use as a base of operations when traveling just to have as a place to store your stuff or if you're like me and have to commute to Baltimore for work. I work the night schedule and can't get back home on late nights because the Marc is shut down by 10-10:30pm and the LightRail doesn't go far enough south to be useful beyond going to Glen Burnie or BWI. I live in Crofton, MD, so there's no easy way to get home from Baltimore, so I have to commute using whatever I have at my disposal.",

Sometimes I mix up numbers in my head like a mild form of dyscalculia (number or math dyslexia), so it took some time and patience. Thankfully, the host was very responsive and patient with me at 10-11pm at night.\nI wish there were paper towels for quick clean ups/spills and a dish drying rack for washing dishes. I also wished that there were drinking glasses (not just a plethora of coffee mugs), oven mitts, and at least one cookie sheet available to easily heat up foods. Certain foods requires an oven to maintain the crispness, but I only had access to a flimsy, disposable and dirty aluminum pan that looked like it was used to catch water from a leaky faucet than to cook food in. Only had dirty, used white towel to use as makeshift oven mitt which got tricky when trying to get the flimsy pan out of the oven because it easily bent and lost its shape holding it from the middle because I didn't have two oven mitts to easily hold the pan by its edges. It was a very near thang, because I ended up dropping some of my food on the floor.",

There are a variety of eateries (China Wok, Korean Barbecue, The Empanada Lady, McDonald's, to name a few) in the vicinity, as well as a gas station / convenience store, Lucky Supermarket, and pharmacy in the vicinity of Graffiti Alley (19th 1/2 St). The surrounding area may seem daunting to some, but it's mostly sprawling and scarcely occupied. Motel 6 Baltimore Downtown itself is a veritable oasis. I would gladly stay there again.",

Upon leaving Monday morning, instead of retrieving our car, the attendant had us follow him to our car in the adjacent lot.  He did at least carry my duffel bag.  I am by no means an entitle person, but I am recovering from a hip/ leg fracture making walking is difficult, so this was a bit disappointing.",

Toilet paper was okay, much better than traditional 1 ply hotel tp. The balcony was nice and roomy and the harbor view was great. Was a little cold so didn't get to enjoy it.

I’ll eat just about anything, so I wasn’t necessarily disappointed, but my significant other won’t. So, that kind of made it uncomfortable since I raved about their food (I’ve stayed before). However, breakfast was included in the room package and it was really good.\nLast thing, the parking situation with the garages is kind of a nightmare. I tried using the coupon I got at the front desk for the overflow garage, and the company declined to accept it. So, I ended up paying $100 to park overnight instead of $30. That doesn’t sit well with me.",

The concept of customer service can’t be comparable to other hotels where you have been before, starting from the moment of your arrival. Yes, it’s quite expensive, but when you arrive you will understand why. \nMy husband has a birthday and all staff make it exceptional!! Perfect spa, very tasty food, recommend to take Benedict eggs with Maryland ham - super tasty. Hotel has a free bar with a variety of different drinks and a big assortment of table games. Our suite number 18 is amazing - interior and lots of small details, separate lift and next door to the spa center!!! I’m grateful to everyone who helped us make this weekends so wonderful!!",

The location was excellent - easy walking distance to the inner harbor attractions, but also far enough away from the more congested areas. Parking was easy and inexpensive at the parking garage across the street - $5 for one night on the weekend!?! Crazy! We would totally stay here again if our travels take us to Baltimore.",

The morning breakfast staff was deffinately the most attentive, nicest and helpful we have ever seen in a hotels breakfast area! The bar tender/waitress in the restaurant was very nice, and even though she was by herself she did an amazing job even with a full bar! (Everywheres is understaffed right now so deffinately no complaining on that here) She handled being by herself like a pro, and we didnt have that long of a wait for our drinks! If we find ourselves staying in the area again this will definately be our choice of hotel!",
