No staff was visible except for check in and check out. While my room seemed fine, the corridor, the stairs, the grounds all seemed filthy and abandoned by the proprietor. The pool was empty.",

      "negative": "This was not a great stay. When I arrived I had to wait a while for someone to show up. The first room I was assigned was supposed to be a non-smoking room (and said Non-smoking) on the door, but had a very strong smell of smoke. That room was largely OK. Unfortunately though, when I returned from dinner the door wouldn't open. The front desk had to get the maintenance man who was off duty to come back to work to open the door. I had to sit around for well over 30 minutes waiting to be let back in the room. Apparently the lock failed and so they ended up having me switch to the room next door. I had quite a bit of stuff I had to move, but at least requiring quite a few trips, but at least it was next door. \nThis new room was in worse condition than the other. It also reeked of cigarette smoke, and was pretty worn out. The lampshades were all cut up (how expensive would it be to replace them), wall switch plates broken, hangers broken in half. The bed and pillows were not very comfortable. \nI've stayed in many budget hotels and this was a definite disappointment. I know things happen and while the lock issue was a pain, I can (sort of) forget that. The condition of the room though indicated just poor maintenance though. For the price you can do better. And I really would have expected more from a Days Inn.",

It really just seemed like the location was lacking sufficient funding to replace pretty much anything, like even washcloths that looked like they were actually cleaning rags and there was what we assumed were cords duct taped along the edge of the room in the entry way. The location also seemed very understaffed with housekeepers which could explain why the room was so dirty. There were quite a few unsavory people who just milled around outside in the parking lot and surrounding parking lots but we didn't have any issues with our cars thankfully but this certainly wasn't the Inns fault, just more a warning to maybe request a room in the front.",

I just think that emergency chargers should be available.  A note:  my room did not have a clock charger that allows phones to sit on the charger and charge - mine was an old fashioned one that required a charger cord (which was my problem to begin with).\nI find it odd that the hotel is charging for bottled water.

Breakfast is a lovely assortment of fresh fruits, muffins and hot/cold drinks.  the Inn is located on the north, quieter side of Fresno but is conveniently close, within a mile, to several good eating places including quick places like In N Out Burgers and MacDonalds.  if you are looking for a pleasant, safe, welcoming place to stay in the Fresno area, I highly recommend the Garden Inn.",
