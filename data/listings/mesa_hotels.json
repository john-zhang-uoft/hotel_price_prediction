Someone had some anger issues and punched the bathroom door. 2 times the rooms were extremely dirty with horrible smell and it wasn’t smoke smell it was rotting something\n even though I couldn’t find it. I couldn’t even sleep in the bed. I slept sitting up in a chair I was worried the bed had bed bugs.",

It’s supposed to be what u check in with which was in my case so lesson learned for me to first ask which is the question they should reverify with customers upon check in.

Ad says they offer free breakfast, which is 3 pots of coffee in the loddy. Public areas are not well cleaned. Elevator sometimes did not want to work plus dirty. The cook top in the room was an old style 2 place hot plate style. Light fixtures in room were old and some had damage. If you wanted cooking items, pans, plates etc you had to get items from the front desk, if they had the item. You had to enter thru the front lobby door. Could not enter thru exterior doors becasue they had removed all all access swipe pads. Guests & employees blocked exterior doors open so they could go outside to smoke. When done doors were left blocked open and unsecured. Have never had a hotel ask for ID's from others staying in the room. To me this is a red flag that they have issues at this property.\nIn the past stayed at a Hilton Homes 2 Suites in the area. Had none of these issues and was minimally more.",

I was told I would be given 30 extra minutes but asked for roughly 1.5 to 2 hours. But again was told that I can only get 30 minutes. For $20.00 I would be allowed the 1.5 to 2 hours I had requested originally. I declined the offer. As a result of the 20.00 for extra time to confirm we would be staying longer and the plumbing issue, we decided to go somewhere else.. overall most of our stay was fine. I was under the impression that if nothing else from the fact that we extended our stay 3 or 4 times rebooking the room that it would be expectable for a late check out or rebooking.",

      "positive": "We had stayed in this hotel back in October 2022. We liked the fact that Hyatt Place at this location had availability 2 weeks prior to our arrival. We also loved this hotel's close  location to restaurants and the movie theater.",
      "negative": "Booked our room via online booking.com agent.The total price for one night stay was over $400. Very disappointed with the price gouging. I understand the need to raise prices, but not to the extreme. Not able to understand why hotels raise their prices to the extreme whenever major events are in town. I was further disappointed after being overcharged for this room and later offered a lower price for future bookings. In October 2022, I paid $555 for a total of 3 nights stay for 3 guests in this same hotel. \n  Another thing we didn't like in this hotel is the low voltage lighting in our bathroom. The lighting in our bathrooms in our past visit and recent visit was very poor. Not sure how housekeeping can clearly see how to sanitize and properly clean the bathtub and toilet. \n  Lastly, the mattress on one of the beds in our room was so badly worn and broken down. It was very difficult  sleeping on this bed with the mattress collapsing to the point of near-dumping me onto the floor. I couldn't sit on the bed to get in it from the side that shared the nightstand. I had to get in the bed from the opposite side to avoid the mattress collapsing. This mattress should be replaced. I had to carefully sleep on the opposite side of that bed. We didn't ask to change our room because we arrived late, exhausted and didn't want to go through any hassle trying to find out if the hotel had a better room available.",

      "negative": "The reason we chosed the hotel was trying to recap old memories when my husband were a kid. Overall it's a really old hotel but still charging the same rate as other newer hotels. I'm sure it has been renovated a few times over 40 years(when my husband was a litle kid)but I guess if it still wants to charge the similar amount and really want to compete with others, it could be better(or cheaper). The one thing I think it's worth paying is their swimming pool (Jacuzzi is hot but broken-no jets/bubbles). Because this swimming pool was built long time ago without brand standard, it still kept the original shape which is huge. You don't find any other chain hotels now has this type of swimming pools anymore. That's actually the reason we picked this hotel(other than memory lane reason). We came for spring training- stayed 2 night 3 days and spent a lot of time by the swimming pool...that was great!",

Later the next morning, my card was charged a damage fee for smoking weed in my room. The employee had charged my card before they had ever come to my room, and they had to reverse the charge after they came to my room, which put my bank account in the negative and left me with no money to get home.",

Shower and toilet was clean, There was a blow dry and Coffee pot on hand. Thank you!\n We left early, -No breakfast available for Early flight out. Breakfast hours:  7am-10am only. Our flight left at 7:30 am, so we had to leave at 4:45 am by Taxi to get to airport on time.  (We were up at 3:00am getting ready.)  I bet this happens a lot with other staying guest.

Thank goodness the Manager on hand was able to help the RUDE guest \"Courtney\"- raging out of control trying to continue with her Bad attitude to get in a room that was NOT hers, WELL- she's \"got 250k follows\" \"Don't you know who I am!\"  IF, she started Videoing When she Stated she did, THEN I would say she was Premeditating that she was going to incite a fight. She than tried getting in with her own credit card with another Concierge and OH, what a surprise RUDE Courtney's Credit Card didn't work.( probably why she had the room under a \"friends\" name in the first place.)\n It's good to see that \"people\" can not just get into other \"peoples\" reservations, Because they are \"a Friend\".  If the Reservation is NOT on your Credit Card than its NOT your Room to enter.  It's a Simple guide line for Providing Privacy and Security.  THANK YOU, MANGER ON DUTY for trying to keep your REAL Guest safe.\nother then that - Bad pillows and No early breakfast on a weekend.",

My biggest problem with this chain is less the chain than it is the customer it attracts. I had no problem with this location but rather the people staying at it. First off the place smelled of weed, not the room but just in general you'd smell it. There was another couple constantly arguing the woman being locked out while the man held her dogs hostage. The police came. I stayed at a Motel 6 in Cheyenne and the cops were there as well. I think Motel 6 screwed up when they were \"leaving the light on.\"",

After checking into the right room, we had a cockroach problem in the bathroom, so I called housekeeping, and they came by and took care of it. \n4. The water bottles in the room cost $5.00, so luckily, I did not drink one. If you pay money for the room, the water should be free. \n5.

She said it was only a couple minutes away.  I called after I got my bags and was then told they would arrange a Lyft to pick me up.  They had to arrange ride and it was over hour before Lyft arrived.  \nI tried to iron a shirt and there was some sticky stuff on the iron that i did not notice until I put it on my shirt and it stuck to my shirt.  I notified the \"manager\" in the morning and she said, \"sorry\" and walked away.  No offer to pay for my shirt which was not expensive but the offer would have been appreciated.  Also the knowledge that she would let housekeeping know to check the iron before putting them back in closet for the next person to use. The day clerk did deduct $15 off my bill after the manager woman walked away.  \nI also told her that there was no light bulb in my bathroom above the sink...only above the toilet.  It was very dark in the bathroom but I checked in after midnight so I did not mention it then and I was checking out in the morning.  Again, I would have liked her to say, she would remind housekeeping to report this to maintenance.  \nMy TV would not work, the cables in the back were unplugged.  I told the lady manager and again she said nothing.  \nAll these things could have been avoided if housekeeping had notified someone when they prepared the room for the next guest.   I suggested they create. a checklist for housekeeping to use at checkout",

The seating area is well kept up with cleanliness and sanitation products were at your convenience.  The location is also one of my other favorite things about Homes2 Suites.  There are great mountain views nearby, along with a beautiful lush green golf course and if you are bringing your pet, there is a devoted area where you can take them to relieve themselves.  The feel of this place was so relaxing and peaceful, like all my stress just vanished.  All the staff and amenities were so great in making Homes2 Suites a friendly environment, I definitely will be back.",
