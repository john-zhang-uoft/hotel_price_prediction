This smell was so bad it coated my throat, tongue and nose with a bitter taste, burned my eyes, and made me feel dirty after taking a Shower.\nThe Curtain was soiled, had Holes and one side of it hung down to partially expose the Room's Interior. One Hole was large enough that I had to stuff  a piece of Paper Bag through it to prevent Peeping Toms. I had to relocate a Hook in the Curtain to attach it to the side of the Traverse Rod Fixture to secure my privacy.\nThe Ceiling was unfinished by the Window where there might have been a Light Fixture.\nTHE WALLS: are filthy with protruding Nails.\nTHE SINK AREA:\nPeeled Wall Paper, no Hot Water, the Faucet moves around, the Towel Rack soiled with dust.\nTHE BED:\nI did not examine the Mattress, but it was comfortable and the Linen seems very clean.\nFlies perching on my Bed and Towels; so unsanitary.\nTHE BATHROOM:\nThere is an inoperable Exhaust Fan that seems to be out of commission also for 20years. This is probably where the five Flies came from; I killed four of them.\nTowel Rack is soiled with dust.\nThe Step Towel was either stained or dirty.\nThe Faucet is loose and seems fragile.\nTHE PROPERTY:\nExtremely filthy and smelly.\nGrounds Staff not friendly, you have to make a request many times before they understand.\nIt doesn't take much to deep clean once per Week.\nRooms should look and smell clean and fresh.\nThe Grounds should be hosed down with Bleach or some disinfection.\nOutside fixtures and Elevators should be sanitised.",

For the price, I hoped they would offer substitutes and I called ahead to plan. They do not currently have vegan/vegetarian meat subs, so we did not get the value of breakfast included as would meat eaters (traditional bacon and sausage only). For the price and considering the quaintness of the hotel, I honestly expected an accommodation. Overall, the location is great and the quaintness won us over. We had massages just steps away from the lobby at Harbor Town Spa and the price and services were excellent.",
      "negative": "The housekeeping needed more attention to detail. We found several long strands of hair in the tub and in several places on the bathroom floor. The curtains had what appeared to be stains on them and there were paint patches on the walls. For the cost, I would have expected they inspect the rooms closer and replace and repair items so they are not noticed by guests. The thermostat wasn't properly functioning, and we were either too hot or too cold. The property itself is very nice, but some updating of the menu and more attention to the details in the rooms would have gotten a higher rating.",

And they had good bath products. The shampoo, conditioner, soap, and shower gels were great. I have long hair and I always need extra shampoo and conditioner. Sometimes hotels don’t want to give me an extra shampoo and conditioner but they were very nice about it  and they even brought it up to room which I appreciated. We also wanted a Diet Coke at one point. The hotel does not have vending machines so I called the Terrace restaurant and they came right over and delivered Diet Cokes to our room and they even brought us a refill which we did not ask for but it was nice that they did that anyway. The lady at the front desk was very nice.  All of the cleaning staff where nice. All around just very nice people that anticipated our needs and did a great job.",
      "negative": "My stay included breakfast every morning; however, the restaurants at the hotel changed the menus for Easter.   I was not allowed to get regular breakfast food. Instead they were offering an abbreviated  menu that did not include regular breakfast food (eggs, bacon, toast) and we were told no exceptions to the Easter menu.  There was only one thing I could eat that was being offered and that was an appetizer for breakfast.  I would have gone somewhere else for breakfast but we couldn’t find anything that was open that did not need prior reservations because of the holiday. Not the end of the world but it was annoying since I took the holiday into consideration when I was planning the trip so that I could ensure we were able to eat somewhere that day. \nAlso, I have very bad allergies to down and asked in my booking request that there be no down pillows and bedding in the room. When we arrived, my husband always does a sweep of the room to check for down before I come in the room.  Sure enough, three of the 6 pillows had down in them. He was able to remove the pillows and put them in a closet before I came in the room. The pillows did not touch my side of the bed so I was able to lay in the sheets without having to change them and  I did not have an allergy attack. I would just suggest though that they make sure to pay special attention to allergy accommodation requests because allergies are no joke and can actually kill someone. I do carry an epipen for severe allergy attacks. To present date, I have never had to use the epipen for down reactions; however I do have several allergies that I  have had to use it for.  But hives, itching, swelling, watery eyes, and nasal symptoms are my normal reaction to down and that would not have been fun to experience on the trip and thankfully that did not happen but very easily could have. \nOverall, the hotel was very nice and I would definitely go back.",

The room was a nice mid sized room and was very clean. The shower had 2 shower heads, one which was removable. The breakfast was nice and flavorful and seasoned to perfection. Ample seating in the lobby area. The staff was great. we stay NYE and one of the staff members ever helped us search for spots open late night for food after we partied all night on Beale street which was right up the street. walking distance.",
      "negative": "After being on the road you’d expect to be able to check right into your hotel. Our check in was at 3pm however we weren’t able to check in until after 6pm. We arrived shortly after 4pm. They offered us free food and drinks at the bar which really helped knock the edge off. Luckily we didn’t have reservations for dinner. The staff remained calm and there was no sign of frustration on anyone’s face. They did apologize and worked quickly to get the crowed lobby serviced.  Nothing but respect for them. Upon checking out, I’m assuming a manager, also informed me that she would be taking $100 off our room as well. Even though this is in the negative section, their good outweighed the couple hours of checkin delay. Thank you.",

Food is a big part of hotels and it’s not very accommodating to have bad food at the hotel therefore having to make me take a shuttle out of the hotel just to have decent food.  The lookout tower could easily be turned into a 5 star Michelin restaurant if there was some money being put into the restaurant aspect of this place and therefore would boost the revenue. The operators for the lookout tower did not charge multiple groups to go up because they did not want to pay the price. Saw this happen 4 times within the hours of 12:30pm-1:30pm Wednesday the 15th",

But sadly the day we arrived is the day the pool closed for testing or readings of the water levels. (During the 4th of July weekend really) Therefore we had to find things to do during our stay. Things we didn’t really want to do ! We wanted to hang out at the pool again one of the main reasons why we choose the hotel. One other thing that I did not like was the bathroom toilet was stained yellow around the toilet floor! Ew! I paid for all 3 rooms in total of $1825 this included the breakfast or so I thought. Each room was booked for 4 people but only 2 people got to enjoy the breakfast because at check in I was informed that $1825 booked for 4 people per room only covers 2 people for breakfast each additional person was $15 each day (breakfast was not worth $15 for some powered eggs lol) after all that I still had to pay $150 deposit for each room I also thought that was a little high for a deposit. And a non working pool! I had to pay for parking even though we where Guest staying at their property that I was already paying for Need I remind you of the $1825 The extra $15 for each person for powdered eggs and the three $150 deposit for each room but now $22 for each of the 3 cars to have a parking spot really!!!!!

On a few occasions I was made to feel like a burden, I checked in Christmas Day, and one of the staff members was more interested in entertaining their friends rather than serving (the other staff member was nice). Could just be that Id had a full day of travel, so was hungry, tired and grumpy. I arrived late so got a few snacks from the pantry for dinner, but the hummus was out of date. \nThe water issue. The issue itself wasn’t the hotels fault, but the way it was handled was poor from my perspective. Nice that bottled water was offered, but the staff on the desk were short and rude when asked where I could go to use the bathroom - if people are staying in a hotel, they’re likely not a local, so any help or guidance is appreciated and just a little of what could be offered in the circumstances, especially given they’re familiar with the area. Was also told that all guests received a phone call and an email, I received neither - not an issue; I couldn’t go anywhere, but I was made to feel stupid because I knew nothing about the issue. \nI will say that this wasn’t all staff, most were actually really friendly, but the above were the only two occasions I had to get help so one-on-one interactions.",

The hotel sent me an email before I arrived so check-in would be easier, and so I could already go into my room before the official check-in time once the room would be ready. That did not work at all and just complicated everything including how I had planned the day. I got the email that my room would be ready at around 10 am, but was told I should not try to ask again for check-in before 2 pm, because that email/check-in system would in fact not reflect reality.",

One man came to see if anything needed to be vacuumed and one to assess damage, however they only looked and didn't offer to clean the bathroom or send someone.  If we didn't have 2 rooms I would've been very mad.  I took a shower in the other room.",

The staff never left the front desk, and no one else was around for assistance except to ask if we wanted water.  We asked for clean towels twice and never received them; by day three, we also were out of coffee, and the trash was overflowing",

However, no pots and pans or dishes to be able to make use of the kitchen!  Everything was very clean, bathroom very nice as well.  I was also able to do my laundry in a very large, multiple machine laundry room.",
      "negative": "The internet was very poor.  They provide a very slow (2 bars) internet that is only good for basic use.  For a higher speed you must pay $6 a day for the internet.  I was amazed as this was the first time on my 4 week trip that a hotel was charging for internet.  I was also concerned about the groups of men loitering in the parking lot....10-12 guys just hanging around talking and smoking.  Not sure what they were doing and I was a bit concerned for my car.",

However, after we were making plans to go back home, she proceeded to give us a room about 15 minutes later. With the already frustrating encounter and inconvenience from the third party website confusion, the tone, attitude, and sarcasm were not needed. We were very nice and were not unpleasant in any manner, unlike her. No one made her choose the job and position she has. If she is unhappy, she either needs to quit or take up her concerns to her boss because the customers are the ones who give her a job to do in the first place.

We would have saved money by choosing a higher priced hotel closer to the airport. \nBooking.com’s listing said “free cancellation anytime.” It was only after making the reservation that we received an email confirmation stating that we could not cancel for free after 6 PM - that is not the same as “anytime.”\nThe room was in disrepair, appearing as if it was undergoing remodeling. An extra mattress leaned against the wall. There was standing water on the bathroom floor.  Painting and other other repairs were unfinished or sloppily applied.\nThere was only one towel for the two of us, no visible wastebasket, no drinking cups and no hangers in the closet. The security lock on the inside of the door was broken. Perhaps most disappointing, though the room was marked “no smoking,” it had a very strong smell of smoke, as if the rooms around or below it were smoking rooms.",

Also the hotel is not up to Hilton standards to charge a 300.00 hundred dollar hold when the sofa got stains and the carpet do too, with cig burns on the side end tables as well , I took pictures will be glad to post them also with the rusty towel rack I got pictures .

The lack of a room service also is a low point to me. The week of my stay was under the worse weather, with icy storms, so one night I could not have dinner at the restaurant because there were so many people in there, they have stopped serving food. No food delivery up was working that night, as result I had to eat some Lays chips I bought in the little market inside :(",

The lack of a room service also is a low point to me.

No food delivery up was working that night, as result I had to eat some Lays chips I bought in the little market inside :(",

Firstly they don’t inform you on the booking that you have to pay $50 per room as a “clean/safety” fee that you will only get back once you check out and they check the room. Then you have the fact that you can’t access some of the rooms considering the fact that there’s a huge hole in the floor (and it was right next to my door). Going into the room, the door is raggedy, the room smelled musty, and the tub and toilet was disgusting. Honestly if I wasn’t being charged $81 to cancel, I would’ve canceled and went to another hotel.

      "positive": "The hotel is at the left side of Graceland which was our main reason to visit Memphis.  The rooms have beautiful pictures of Elvis suits and/or cars.  The room is beautiful.  They have a cinema to watch Elvis movies.  The Lobby is beautiful too.  It is a must stay hotel if you are an Elvis Presley's Fan.  Graceland guest relations place is across the street and you can walk to the gates of Graceland from the hotel.  The restaurant for breakfast is great, (not included on the room rate).",
      "negative": "Service at the EP's Bar and Grill was not great.  We had to wait almost 20 minutes for craft beers to arrive at out table while the server was talking to other servers.  The wait time was uncomfortable. The only one who was kind to us while at the table, was the lady who was cleaning the table.",

The breakfast offered was odd but in a good way. There were pre-packaged stuffed pastries and pepperoni hot pockets. I may be a child but I actually preferred that weird selection versus most budget hotel breakfast options.",

This is obviously not the hotel's fault, just FYI. Also, food delivery in the area is a bit limited, even the app-based stuff.\nThe window air conditioner worked well and first but it's performance seemed to slip as the night went on. It was also a bit noisy (squeals, shrieks). I like my room ice cold and while I didn't get too warm it was borderline (i.e., I didn't need to sleep under the covers).",

There was no food at the hotel (hadn't eaten all day when I arrived) and would require a drive in unfamiliar area to go find some.

And this location is kind of not near anything itself except other hotels.   I don't know if there was breakfast served, but I did grab  tiny to-go coffee on my way out since the in-room coffee maker didn't work.

We ordered the basic breakfast. 2 eggs scrambled with bacon and toast. About 15 or 20 min later a server came with one breakfast. Two people at the table myself with wife.  Another 15 min or so they came with the 2nd breakfast. No silver ware, no butter or jam with toast.  Other people in eating area were leaving not served.  The food quality was below average.  Basically if you are planning to use this restaurant do not plan on eating breakfast.  We were at the eating area around 9:30 am. I can't imagine what the service was like at the busy time.  The serving people were trying but just overwhelmed.  Maybe current travelers do no eat breakfast.",

      "negative": "Sofa bed was showing signs of age. Only had extra sheets for it. Would have been nice to have an extra blanket. We didn't ask for one so it may have been provided if asked for.  Fridge didn't have a freezer and microwave turn table seemed to not want to fit properly but they worked.  Might want to make sure the Keurig Coffee Maker is cleaned a little better.  Our first cup the water heated but never brewed. Took the pod holder out, ran water through it in the  bathroom sink and a good bit of \"stuff\" washed out of it.  Dumped the water out of the reservoir and realized it had stuff floating in it so rinsed that out as  well.  No more issues after a good cleaning.",

Additionally,  the hotel is on a great street. There are plenty of fast food locations to choose from, and again, you can always jump on the interstate  and go either up or down an exit to get to sit down dining.  The hotel was clean and quiet. The staff was very friendly and the room attendants were nice. There were no issues with getting additional towels and face cloths. The hotel also comes with an indoor pool. There is a lounge area in the lobby that is family-friendly. I and my two adult siblings shared  the double queen bedroom with a sofa. There was plenty of room for us and all our stuff. There was plenty of storage room in the closet to house our luggage, and the refrigerator was large enough to handle our Togo boxes from dinner.",
      "negative": "There isn't much to say here.. Overall, the place is great. When coming back to Memphis, we will stay here again. Some of the things that we wish were better communicated was about breakfast. If you reserved the rooms through a third party, you have to show them your reservations that you paid for breakfast. Additionally. Regardless of how many people you tell them are staying in the room. It only covers up to 2 people. Each person gets a $10 daily breakfast credit. You do have to order off the breakfast menue and anything you order over your credit amount is billed. Nothing other than coffee is readily available. You will need to call in or go to the bar and put your order in. The menu is limited. Although we paid for the breakfast options, we ended up just going to breakfast while we were out. Be sure to pack your conditioners, shampoo, and soap. I have never seen such small bottles it definitely isn't enough for one person, let alone 3. However, the  Family Dollar is just a block over. It was not hard to just pick some up.",

Friday around 3:30 am the fire alarm went off for 10 minute straight with no explanation, when we went downstairs to figure out what happened- the front desk lady came out and said “what are y’all standing around for, y’all can go back to bed, the alarm was tripped.” Her attitude was absolutely horrible & not once did she say sorry for any of it. Saturday came and the power was out for 2 hours. The breakfast is a joke for the amount of money you spend on the room. Blood stains on carpets. We called before arrival about pots & pans being in the room since we had kitchenettes & the lady told me yes ma’am, there’s a full set of both in each room— not true.

I love having a ceiling fan, but keep the thing clean! Ours was not. The breakfast was ok. No waffle maker, no toaster. Provided bagged bagels but no way to toast. And no sliced bread at all.

I had a person working the front desk come up once and ask if I needed another, but aside from that I spent a lot of time waiting to order another drink. Also, $7 for a domestic bootle of beer is a bit much. The menu is very limited as well. I will say however the food was pretty good though.",

I had no one to pick up laundry or trash, no silverware in room. I was told I have to take laundry to the front to get new clean. It to me is inconveniencing for your money.

In addition during the night someone appeared to be arrested outside my friend's room, and there was a knocking on my window about 2am, making us feel wary about our location. We could not wait to get out of there and back on the road. Even my dog seemed uncomfortable in the room, not sure why- she just seemed to sense something - she was raring to go in the am.\nBasically i felt the rate was too high for what we got.

In a very rude manner she said \"If it's closed it's closed.\" For someone in a management position her customer service skills need work. Kristin was on duty later that night and was just as nice and kind as Christopher. She was very sympathetic  that we had very late evening departure flight the next day.  She did go over the options  of staying  a bit longer. Upon checking out the next day Christopher also gave the option to do a late check out which would have been an additional 10.00 for an hour because the manager only allows a guest to stay until noon, anything beyond that you have to pay for an entire day.  Christopher  and Kristin were wonderful and in my opinion should be in management positions.",
