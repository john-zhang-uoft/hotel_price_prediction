Couldn't hear the furnace through the closed bedroom door, but somewhat disturbing to the person who was on the sofa bed.",

Also, the fire department knocked on our door circa 11:30pm because a faulty fire alarm would not stop blaring. Accidents will happen and I don't necessarily hold the hotel culpable for that bizarre incident.",

The location was also very central, easy to walk to restaurants and downtown.\nBreakfast was great too with a bunch of options in pastry, fruit, and yogurt. You could also always get access to coffee and tea in the common rooms.",
      "negative": "The room was slightly cold because of the wind coming through the window panes. To be fair, the inn is already doing a lot to help with this, such as having towels at the window to block out the wind, or offering an extra set of blankets. Nevertheless, it was still a bit cold to stay in winter.\nI think the inn is still worth to stay in because of how amazing the decor is, just come prepared with good warm pajamas if you are staying during the winter time.",

The redo is attractive, but it is somewhat industrial.  The beds and bathrooms were glorious.    The deepest sleep I have had in months...  Air-con/ventilation was superb -- ran on the cool side, which we liked.    Nice arm chair and chaise.   In and out valet, which we didn't use, but helpful.  Very nice double window shades -- blackout and transparent shade screen, on pullers.   The shower was delicious with various toiletries (wash, cream, shampoo, conditioner) -- fragrant soap.",
      "negative": "Lighting in the rooms is a bit weird.  No light at the desk, yet bright lights at the entrance and in various corners.  One small desk and small chair -- not the best for those needing to do work.   The windows are not entirely soundproof.  Though we generally had quiet, there was a 5 am garbage collection that was quite noisy -- and we were in the back on an alley!   The hotel restaurant is spacious with unique furnishings, but breakfast was semi-take-out, with limited menu, with some items failing.  Service was great.   We did not eat dinner there, but we noted a good crowd on a weeknight the evening we arrived.   We didn't fully realize that the one night reservation we had was fully pre-pay, but that's our bad.",

I especially enjoyed the in-room deep soaking claw foot tub. Thoughtful details were peppered throughout the room. The front desk went above and beyond when I had injured my foot during my stay. They don't allow meal delivery services, like door dash, to deliver to the club. But one call to the front desk and, even though the restaurant was closed for that evening, the chef made me a delicious meal!",
      "negative": "Because this is a historic building, the windows were single-pane and a bit drafty. They aren't very good at noise reduction, so early in the morning and into the late evening,  I could hear the sound of the city public transportation quite clearly - and the buzzing alert sound of the parking garage across the street every time a car left the building. I also had a slight issue on check-in when I was arriving very early on a red eye flight, so I booked the room starting the night of my flight so I could check into the hotel immediately to get some rest.  Despite communicating my intent and getting assurance that they would check me into the room the night I was flying, the night security wasn't informed so when I arrived there was some confusion whether I was a no show or not. Alex at the front desk cleared it up when they arrived, though!",

The Sonder itself is on a dead block with not many restaurants or attractions, but everything in downtown is easy walking distance. Probably a ten minute walk to Campus Martius and the Q-Line, fifteen/twenty minute walk from all the sport stadiums. Extremely easy to check in and check out, company provides a code a few days in advance. Nice to just use the code and not have to keep track of a key. Overall would recommend a stay if you are in downtown Detroit for an event, concert, or sports game.",

There were no places to set your stuff because all the people lounging in regular clothes and not using the pool. My thing I wanted to do the most was swim  unfortunately that didn't happen, because of all the loungers laying around. Also big downside the pool closes at 6pm maybe they can stay open longer this way people can go later, when the treatment areas close. I think all the people at poolside were waiting for significant others to get their treatments. They should have a waiting room for that or not be allowed to wait at poolside. There are hallways they could have been told to wait there. It was really annoying, I arrived there before my 4 pm check in, they also couldn't find one of my rooms, the took about 25 minutesto clear up. This took time away from my 2 hour window to use the pool. Then not to be able to swim was really sad.  I'd have to say I probably wouldn't stay again just for the fact the pool closed so early and wasn't able to use all the amenities for the price I paid.",

      "positive": "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel. It's full of nice touches that make all the difference between an ok stay and a great one. Highlights include room service, mini bar, super soft bedding, double shower heads and sinks, ambient lighting, white noise machine, Keurig with Starbucks coffee, in closet lighting, etc. Our 14th floor view was just perfect. Valet parking is free which is pretty much unheard of elsewhere. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed for a concert at the Masonic Temple which was just a 10 minute walk away. After the show, we had delicious Detroit style pizza at the 24 hour food court in the casino. This hotel simply can't get much better. We will be back, hopefully sooner than later!",
      "negative": "Check in was long and confusing. We were told valet parking was $25 when it was actually free for hotel guests. After getting this sorted, the line to check in took an hour! The hotel has two lines, for standard and premium, each with their own staff member. While a long line of regular guests waited an hour, maybe 2 premium guests arrived. It would make sense to have premium staff taking customers when no premium guests are waiting. Instead, one lonely employee had to work her butt off doing it by herself while the other employee sat next to her with no customers. With this said, the apologetic and friendly welcome received quickly made me forget any annoyance, followed by seeing our gorgeous room. Sadly, thanks to these issues, we didn't make it to our room until 5:30 and the pool closes at 6! This is my only real complaint about the hotel. The pool should be open until at least 9, better yet, 11. It then opens at 9 AM while check out is at 11. This doesn't leave much time for getting prepared to check out afterwards. For these reasons, we weren't able to use the pool at all, which was really disappointing.",

Close to everything and public transportation, this exceptional place is big, comfortable, and loaded with cool features like a full kitchen, large living room, and two spacious bedrooms/bathrooms. So much room to spread out. Plus, we had an inquiry that was handled immediately. This isn't a hotel, per se, as there are permanent people living in the building, but it is super cool and very quiet. Plus, we spotted a pool table and a foosball table, so that's cool too.",

We had limited interactions with staff during our stay but all were pleasant. And you can't go wrong with a visit to the Candy Bar or Karl's Diner, both cool spots within the hotel.",
      "negative": "Our room was very \"cozy\" and the smallest I've experienced while staying in the city. Weekend luggage was even a bit difficult to stash for 2 of us so would simply suggest to others to pay attention to room size if that's a concern or you're staying a bit longer.",
